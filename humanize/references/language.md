# Language and grammar patterns (§7-13)

Word choice and sentence grammar: AI-favored vocabulary, dodged simple
verbs, formulaic sentence shapes.

### 7. Overused AI words

**Watch:** Actually, additionally, align with, crucial, delve, emphasizing,
enduring, enhance, fostering, garner, gate/gated/gating (figurative;
preserve established technical usage), genuine/genuinely, highlight (verb),
interplay, intricate/intricacies, key (adjective), landscape (abstract
noun), latent, pivotal, quietly, seam (figurative), settled (figurative),
showcase, tapestry (abstract noun), testament, underscore (verb), valuable,
vibrant **Problem:** AI writing uses these words far more often than people
do, especially in groups. Count a cluster, never a single word; placement
metaphors such as load-bearing belong to §37 in `register`.

<before>
Additionally, a distinctive feature of Somali cuisine is the incorporation of camel meat. An enduring testament to Italian colonial influence is the widespread adoption of pasta in the local culinary landscape, showcasing how these dishes have integrated into the traditional diet.
</before>

<after>
Somali cuisine also includes camel meat, which is considered a delicacy. Pasta dishes, introduced during Italian colonization, remain common, especially in the south.
</after>

### 8. Avoiding is and are

**Watch:** serves as/stands as/marks/represents [a], boasts/features/offers
[a] **Problem:** Simple verbs such as is, are, and has replaced with longer
phrases.

<before>
Gallery 825 serves as LAAA's exhibition space for contemporary art. The gallery features four separate spaces and boasts over 3,000 square feet.
</before>

<after>
Gallery 825 is LAAA's exhibition space for contemporary art. The gallery has four rooms totaling 3,000 square feet.
</after>

### 9. Not X but Y and clipped negative endings

**Problem:** Overused "Not only...but..." and "It's not just X, it's Y"
frames, plus clipped endings such as "no guessing" where a clear clause
belongs.

<before>
It's not just about the beat riding under the vocals; it's part of the aggression and atmosphere. It's not merely a song, it's a statement.
</before>

<after>
The heavy beat adds to the aggressive tone.
</after>

<before case="tailing negation">
The options come from the selected item, no guessing.
</before>

<after>
The options come from the selected item without forcing the user to guess.
</after>

<before case="staccato negation">
No config file. No daemon. No surprises. Just a binary.
</before>

<after>
It ships as one binary and needs no config file or daemon.
</after>

The staccato form carries no "not just", so a scan for the phrase misses it.
Watch for two or more sentences in a row that begin with No or Not a.
Cutting the negated half can change what the sentence claims; apply
invariant 5 before the rewrite stands.

### 10. Forced groups of three

**Problem:** Ideas forced into triads to sound complete.

<before>
The event features keynote sessions, panel discussions, and networking opportunities. Attendees can expect innovation, inspiration, and industry insights.
</before>

<after>
The event includes talks and panels. There's also time for informal networking between sessions.
</after>

### 11. Changing names and repeating sentence openings

**Problem:** Repetition handled by rule instead of by ear: the same person
or thing keeps getting renamed, or several sentences open with the same
subject, often she or he. Use one clear name for one subject. For repeated
openings, merge sentences, change the subject when that helps, or begin with
the action.

<before case="synonym cycling">
The protagonist faces many challenges. The main character must overcome obstacles. The central figure eventually triumphs. The hero returns home.
</before>

<after>
The protagonist faces many challenges but eventually triumphs and returns home.
</after>

<before case="repeated openings">
She noted the door. She noted the lock on it. She filed both away.
</before>

<after>
She noted the door and its lock, then filed both away.
</after>

Do not ban the repeated word. Fix the repeated sentence pattern. The
remaining sentence may still start with "She."

### 12. False from X to Y ranges

**Problem:** "from X to Y" where X and Y do not form a real range.

<before>
Our journey through the universe has taken us from the singularity of the Big Bang to the grand cosmic web, from the birth and death of stars to the enigmatic dance of dark matter.
</before>

<after>
The book covers the Big Bang, star formation, and current theories about dark matter.
</after>

### 13. Passive voice and missing subjects

**Problem:** The actor hidden or the subject dropped. Use active voice when
it makes the actor and action clearer.

<before>
No configuration file needed. The results are preserved automatically.
</before>

<after>
You do not need a configuration file. The system preserves the results automatically.
</after>

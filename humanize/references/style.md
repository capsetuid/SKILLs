# Style patterns (§14-19)

Typography and formatting: dashes, bold, headings, emoji, quote marks. All
mechanically checkable by searching the text.

### 14. Em and en dashes

**Rule:** The final rewrite must not contain an em dash (U+2014) or an en
dash (U+2013) unless the writer's sample uses them; then match the sample's
rate. Replace each with a period, comma, colon, or parentheses, or rewrite
the sentence. Also catch a spaced hyphen and a double hyphen used as dashes.
The example below uses the en dash and double-hyphen forms; the em dash
behaves identically.

### 15. Too much bold text

**Problem:** Words and phrases bolded without a clear reason.

### 16. Lists with bold mini-headings

**Problem:** Vertical lists in which every item starts with a bold label and
a colon.

<before>
- **User Experience:** The user experience has been significantly improved with a new interface.
- **Performance:** Performance has been enhanced through optimized algorithms.
- **Security:** Security has been strengthened with end-to-end encryption.
</before>

<after>

### 17. Title case in headings

**Problem:** Every main word of a heading capitalized.

### 18. Emojis and decorative rules

**Problem:** Emojis added to headings and list items as decoration, and
horizontal rules (`---`) placed between sections where a heading or a
paragraph break already separates them. A rule that a format needs (front
matter, a required thematic break) stays.

**Problem:** Curly quotes (“...”) where the writer or target format uses
straight quotes ("...").

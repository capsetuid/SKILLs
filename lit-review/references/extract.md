# Extract: Reading, Records, Appraisal

Turn each included paper into one extraction record. Synthesis reads the
records; anything missing from them needs a re-read later.

## Reading order and depth

- Start with the anchor: the included paper most cited by the others.
- Read each paper's `pdf_url` with `/read-pdf`; its page markers become
  the claim locations in the extraction record. When no PDF is reachable,
  fall back to the landing page's HTML text, then to the abstract as the
  floor. After each
  paper, set its `read_level` (`abstract` or `full-text`) with `update`.
  Invariant 5 makes this label the ceiling for how its claims appear in the
  report.
- A survey among the included papers is read for its own claims and its
  reference list; per invariant 5, its summaries of other papers are cited
  as the survey's characterization, never as those papers.

## Extraction record

One record per paper, jotted onto the session pad: `status` and `brief`
list included papers with no extraction entry. Fill only what the source states; write "not reported" for the
rest. The body is free beyond `kind` and `key`: add per-paper
hypothesis-directed questions whenever the argument needs them, and the
jot advisory warns on a key the corpus lacks.

## Quality appraisal

Appraise while reading, one judgment per dimension, weighed together and
never summed into one score:

| Dimension | Question |
| --- | --- |
| Method | Does the design actually test the claim? |
| Data | Is the sample or dataset adequate and appropriate? |
| Review status | Peer-reviewed, or preprint (label, do not penalize)? |
| Reproducibility | Code, data, or protocol available? |
| Consistency | Do the numbers in text, tables, and abstract agree? |
| Independence | Funding or affiliation that bears on the claim? |

At full, appraisal shapes how much weight a paper carries in synthesis and
is mentioned where it matters. At ultra, the report carries the table for
every included paper. Title-mismatch signals are handled at verification,
per `report`.

## Parallel extraction

Delegate through `/summon fanout`, one delegate per included paper. In each
brief: the evidence is the paper's corpus entry and its `pdf_url`; the
rules are the reading order and depth above, with `/read-pdf` as the
reader; the contract is the extraction template, returned as the JSON
object alone. Delegates write no session state; the lead judges each
return, then runs `jot` and `update` itself, so the branch leaves no trace
in the deliverable.

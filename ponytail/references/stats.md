# Ponytail Stats Verb

Display this scoreboard when invoked. One-shot: do NOT change level, write
files, or persist anything.

Figures are benchmark medians published by the upstream ponytail project (5
everyday tasks: email validator, debounce, CSV sum, countdown timer, rate
limiter; three model tiers), measured there. Source:
https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail (`benchmarks/` and its README).

## Scoreboard

Render plain ASCII bars. The bar length shows the measured range; the label
carries the exact figure:

              /ponytail audit  (what's still cuttable)

## Honesty Boundary

Benchmark medians only. NEVER print a per-repo savings number ("you saved X
lines/tokens here"): the unbuilt version was never written, so a live repo
has no baseline to subtract from. The only real per-repo figures come from
`/ponytail debt` (a counted ledger); this card points there.

## Boundaries

One-shot display. Edits nothing, changes no level.

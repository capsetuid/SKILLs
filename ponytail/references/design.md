# Ponytail Design Verb

Plan before code exists by deciding what not to build. Read the
requirements, trace what the codebase already does, then run the ladder
over the plan itself. Produces a plan; edits nothing.

## Output

The kill list, then the build list. One line per requirement:

- `skip:` speculative need, nothing depends on it today. (YAGNI)
- `covered:` the codebase, stdlib, platform, or an installed dependency
  already does it. Name the thing.
- `build:` survives; name the ladder rung it sits on and the minimum shape.

End with the shape of the whole: files touched, new files (fewest
possible), new dependencies (target: zero).

<example for="design" request="Design a notification system: email, SMS, push, user preferences, retry queues, analytics.">
skip: SMS, push. No sender and no consumer today; add a channel when one exists.
skip: analytics. Count sends in the DB you already have, when someone asks.
covered: retry. The job runner already retries; a queue table duplicates it.
build: email send, one function on the existing mailer. rung 5.
build: per-user opt-out, one boolean column. rung 4: DB constraint, no prefs service.
Whole: 1 migration, ~40 lines in existing files, 0 new deps.
</example>

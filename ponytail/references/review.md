# Ponytail Review Verb

Judge the diff for smuggled complexity, and only that. One line per finding:
location, what to cut, what replaces it. The diff's best outcome is getting
shorter.

## Format

`L<line>: <tag> <what>. <replacement>.`, or `<file>:L<line>: ...` for
multi-file diffs.

Tags:

- `delete:` dead code, unused flexibility, speculative feature. Replacement:
  nothing.
- `stdlib:` hand-rolled thing the standard library ships. Name the function.
- `native:` dependency or code doing what the platform already does. Name
  the feature.
- `yagni:` abstraction with one implementation, config nobody sets, layer
  with one caller.
- `shrink:` same logic, fewer lines. Show the shorter form.

## Examples

<examples for="review">
  <before>This EmailValidator class might be more complex than necessary, have you considered whether all these validation rules are needed at this stage?</before>
  <after>L12-38: stdlib: 27-line validator class. "@" in email, 1 line, real validation is the confirmation mail.</after>
  <after>L4: native: moment.js imported for one format call. Intl.DateTimeFormat, 0 deps.</after>
  <after>repo.py:L88: yagni: AbstractRepository with one implementation. Inline it until a second one exists.</after>
  <after>L52-71: delete: retry wrapper around an idempotent local call. Nothing replaces it.</after>
  <after>L30-44: shrink: manual loop builds dict. dict(zip(keys, values)), 1 line.</after>
</examples>

## Scoring

End with the only metric that matters: `net: -<N> lines possible.` Nothing
to cut: say `Lean already. Ship.` and stop.

A single smoke test or `assert`-based self-check is the ponytail minimum and
stays.

## Redirects

- Correctness bugs, security holes, and performance: `/pl-theorist review`
- Applying the cuts: `/ponytail refactor`

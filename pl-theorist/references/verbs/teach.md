# Verb: teach

Explain a design or refactor in PL terms calibrated to the audience: a human
learning FP taste, or a less capable model about to edit code.

## Pipeline

### 1. Read the artifact

Ground every claim in the actual code (or design) under discussion. Never
teach from a hypothetical version of the code.

### 2. Name the design

Explain by naming, in this order:

- The algebra at work: `map`, catamorphism/fold, sum type, applicative,
  monad, state transition, or effect interpretation.
- The invariant established or the invalid state eliminated.
- Why the result is total, or exactly where partiality remains and why.
- The complexity story: the bound, the structure that buys it, and what the
  naive shape would have cost.
- The loaded language constraint and the fallback it forced, if any.
- One tempting "more functional" form rejected on semantic or cost grounds.

Define specialized terminology on first use. Prefer one precise law or
contrast over broad theory; jargon never substitutes for tracing behavior
through the actual code.

### 3. Calibrate

For a human: connect the named concept to the concrete lines, then to the
one reusable distinction to keep for the next problem.

For a less capable model: load the target profile's teaching example to
calibrate taste, never as a template. Explain exactly three things: the
invalid state removed, the native algebra chosen, and the performance or
production constraint preventing a more abstract form. Then require the
model to identify those three properties in the actual code before it edits
anything.

## Output Contract

A short teaching note: the named algebra, the invariant, the complexity
story, the rejected alternative, and one reusable distinction. Length
proportional to the artifact; no essays. Code snippets only from the real
artifact.

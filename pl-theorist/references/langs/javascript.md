# JavaScript ES6+ Cost Model

## Disclosed Constraints

- Assume broad ES6 availability. Do not rely on portable tail-call
  optimization.
- JIT engines favor stable, flat object shapes and native arrays. Deep
  immutable wrappers and inconsistent property layouts can inhibit
  optimization and make debugging opaque.
- `filter().map()` creates an intermediate array; callbacks and captured
  closures may allocate. This matters only when scale or measurement makes
  it material.
- Refactors can change `this`, sparse-array behavior, identity, thrown-error
  timing, and promise/microtask order.

## Preferred FP Shapes

- Use native array and iterator primitives with curried
  predicates/projectors.
- Use `const`, replacement values, flat stable objects, and discriminant
  fields.
- Use promises and `async`/`await` as native effect sequencing. Preserve
  concurrency intentionally: sequential `await`, `Promise.all`, and
  `Promise.allSettled` are different algebras.
- Prefer `some`/`every`/`find` and native aggregation where available;
  otherwise use `reduce` with a named accumulator law.
- Prefer plain tagged result objects already used by the project over custom
  `Pipe`, `Map`, `Option`, or immutable-wrapper frameworks.

## Domain and Effect Constraints

- JavaScript cannot statically close a sum type. Use stable discriminant
  fields, factories, module-private constructors, and total eliminator
  functions to enforce the protocol at runtime.
- Represent expected absence with `null` only when the project uses it
  consistently. For expected failure, prefer a flat frozen
  `{ tag, value/error }` result object over exceptions inside the pure core.
- `Object.freeze` is shallow. Prefer fresh flat values and disciplined
  ownership; do not recursively freeze hot object graphs without evidence.
- Distinguish independent `Promise.all` composition from dependent
  sequential `await`. Bound fan-out rather than creating an unbounded
  promise array.
- Propagate `AbortSignal`; remove listeners and release resources with
  `try/finally` or native explicit-resource-management support when the
  runtime target guarantees it.
- Preserve idempotency, transaction boundaries, and diagnostic context when
  retrying promise-based effects.

## React Through a Haskell-Trained Lens

- Derive the React version, renderer, server/client boundary, and state
  library from the project. Do not introduce experimental APIs or a state
  framework to imitate Haskell.
- Treat rendering as a pure function from props and state to UI. Never
  perform I/O, mutation, subscription, timer creation, or state updates
  during render.
- Model component state as stable tagged variants instead of interacting
  booleans and nullable fields. Use event-shaped actions and a pure reducer;
  factories and runtime checks compensate for JavaScript's open object
  model.
- Derive values during render rather than synchronizing redundant state in
  an effect. Use effects only to synchronize with an external system. Put
  user-triggered effects in event handlers when no render synchronization
  exists.
- Keep effect dependencies honest. Cleanup subscriptions and timers,
  propagate `AbortSignal`, and reject stale async completions with a request
  identity or equivalent protocol.
- Update immutably with structural sharing. Use functional state updates
  when the next value depends on the previous value. Never mutate props,
  reducer state, or context values.
- Treat keys as semantic identity. Do not use array indexes for reorderable
  or stateful lists.
- `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `memo` are performance tools only. Add them
  only for measured expensive work, required referential stability, or a
  demonstrated render boundary; account for dependency and retention cost.
- Encapsulate effect interpreters in narrowly named custom hooks, but keep
  domain transitions as ordinary pure functions that can be tested without
  React.

<example for="teaching" framework="react" language="javascript">
<![CDATA[
const initialState = Object.freeze({ tag: "idle" });

function searchReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "requested":
      return { tag: "loading", requestId: action.requestId };
    case "succeeded":
      return state.tag === "loading" && state.requestId === action.requestId
        ? { tag: "loaded", items: action.items }
        : state;
    case "failed":
      return state.tag === "loading" && state.requestId === action.requestId
        ? { tag: "failed", message: action.message }
        : state;
    default:
      throw new TypeError("unknown search action");
  }
}

function SearchStatus({ state }) {
  switch (state.tag) {
    case "idle": return <p>Enter a query.</p>;
    case "loading": return <p>Loading…</p>;
    case "loaded": return <ResultList items={state.items} />;
    case "failed": return <p role="alert">{state.message}</p>;
    default: throw new TypeError("unknown search state");
  }
}

function useSearch(query) {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(searchReducer, initialState);
  useEffect(() => {
    if (query === "") return;
    const controller = new AbortController();
    const requestId = crypto.randomUUID();
    dispatch({ type: "requested", requestId });
    search(query, controller.signal).then(
      items => dispatch({ type: "succeeded", requestId, items }),
      error => {
        if (!controller.signal.aborted) {
          dispatch({ type: "failed", requestId, message: String(error) });
        }
      },
    );
    return () => controller.abort();
  }, [query]);
  return state;
}
]]></example>

React taste: one tag defines each valid UI state; the reducer is a pure state
transition; request identity rejects stale effects; rendering eliminates every
known variant. JavaScript still needs runtime defensive branches.

## Teaching Example

<example for="teaching" language="javascript">
<![CDATA[
const ok = value => Object.freeze({ tag: "ok", value });
const failure = message => Object.freeze({ tag: "error", message });

const parsePort = value => {
  const port = Number(value);
  return Number.isInteger(port) && port > 0 && port <= 65535
    ? ok(port)
    : failure("invalid port");
};

const describe = result => {
  switch (result.tag) {
    case "ok": return `port ${result.value}`;
    case "error": return result.message;
    default: throw new TypeError("unknown result variant");
  }
};
]]></example>

Taste: factories admit only valid ports, the tagged result makes failure data,
and flat stable objects suit the engine. Runtime JavaScript cannot prove that no
third tag exists, so boundary validation remains mandatory.

## Cost Guard

1. Replace recursive collection traversal with native iteration.
2. Use native `filter().map()` for ordinary code. If the intermediate array is
   measured as material, descend to one `reduce` or a direct loop with pure
   helpers.
3. Keep output object fields present and consistently ordered where the hot path
   depends on stable shapes.
4. If currying creates opaque closure towers or material allocation, use named
   unary/binary helpers.
5. Preserve synchronous versus deferred effects and exact promise concurrency.
6. Preserve abort propagation, cleanup, transaction scope, and bounded fan-out.

## Validation Focus

Test empty and sparse arrays, object identity, mutation visibility, exception
timing, promise ordering, and representative hot-path sizes. Do not claim V8 or
SpiderMonkey optimization without measurement or engine evidence.

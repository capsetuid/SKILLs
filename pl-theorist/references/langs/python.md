# Python Cost Model

## Disclosed Constraints

- A Python-level loop costs roughly 50 to 100 ns per iteration, while `str`
  methods, `bytes.translate`, and `re` run in C at 1 to 5 ns per character.
  Linear complexity is necessary, not sufficient: a per-character `for` loop
  is the wrong backend even at O(n). Scan with `find`, `split`, `partition`,
  `translate`, or a compiled pattern, and keep Python iteration proportional
  to the tokens produced, never the characters read.
- A backtracking engine is linear on an unambiguous pattern and exponential
  on an ambiguous one. Nested or adjacent quantifiers over overlapping
  classes (`(a+)+`, `[\w.]+@`) and `\s*` under `re.MULTILINE` are the
  blow-up shapes; one character class with one quantifier is safe. Untrusted
  or agent-supplied patterns need a length cap regardless, since `re` has no
  timeout.
- No tail-call optimization. Unbounded structural recursion consumes one
  frame per element.
- Slicing, concatenation, eager intermediates, and transient wrappers
  increase allocation and GC pressure; recursive head/tail list code can
  become quadratic.
- `map`, `filter`, and generators are lazy and single-pass. Deferral changes
  exception timing, resource lifetime, and when effects occur.
- Python's type hints cannot make runtime input valid without boundary
  checks.

## Preferred FP Shapes

- Prefer explicit `map` and `filter` composition over equivalent
  comprehension syntax so the filter-transform algebra remains visible.
  Yield only when a named predicate, required concrete collection, or
  repository convention makes another form materially clearer.
- Use named curried helpers through `functools.partial` when partial
  application clarifies a reusable operation.
- Prefer generators for streaming and $O(1)$ auxiliary memory.
- Prefer `sum`, `any`, `all`, `min`, `max`, and `next` over generic
  reduction.
- Use `functools.reduce` only for a genuine fold with an explicit
  accumulator invariant.
- Represent closed states with frozen dataclasses, enums, tagged unions, and
  exhaustive type-checker-supported matching where project tooling permits.
- Represent optional/fallible flow with established project types or
  explicit return unions. Do not introduce a runtime monad hierarchy solely
  for syntax.

## Domain and Effect Constraints

- Python has no sealed algebraic data types. Approximate closed sums with
  dataclass variants plus a union and exhaustive type-checker-supported
  `match`; runtime closure is a project convention.
- Use `T | None` for expected absence. Use an established project `Result`
  type for expected failures only when present; otherwise return a small
  tagged union or raise at the imperative boundary according to local
  convention.
- Frozen dataclasses and tuples are only shallowly immutable. Copy or freeze
  nested values only at the ownership boundary that requires it.
- Put invariant checks in one parsing factory. A dataclass constructor
  cannot be made truly private, so document and type-check the construction
  convention.
- Keep files, locks, transactions, and generators inside
  `with`/`async with`. Use `asyncio.TaskGroup` where available for scoped
  child tasks; preserve cancellation rather than swallowing
  `CancelledError`.
- Run independent async effects concurrently only through a bounded, scoped
  mechanism; sequence dependent `await` calls explicitly when later inputs
  come from earlier outputs.
- Bound producer/consumer pipelines with finite iterators, semaphore limits,
  or bounded queues. Do not create every coroutine before applying a
  concurrency limit.

## Teaching Example

<example for="teaching" language="python">
<![CDATA[
from collections.abc import Iterable, Iterator
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Self, TypeGuard


@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class Email:
    value: str

    def __post_init__(self) -> None:
        if "@" not in self.value:
            raise ValueError("invalid email")

    @classmethod
    def parse(cls, raw: str) -> Self | None:
        normalized = raw.strip().lower()
        return cls(normalized) if "@" in normalized else None


def is_email(value: Email | None) -> TypeGuard[Email]:
    return value is not None


def email_value(email: Email) -> str:
    return email.value


def valid_emails(raw_values: Iterable[str]) -> Iterator[str]:
    return map(email_value, filter(is_email, map(Email.parse, raw_values)))
]]></example>

Taste: untrusted strings cross one smart-constructor boundary; absence is
explicit; the result streams. Named functions preserve type narrowing and domain
meaning; point-free cleverness would make this version worse. `__post_init__`
also protects direct construction because Python cannot hide the constructor.

## Cost Guard

1. Replace collection-sized recursion with an iterator or generator.
2. If the caller requires eager output, materialize exactly once at the public
   boundary.
3. If lazy conversion changes exception/effect timing or closes a resource too
   early, preserve eager evaluation inside the resource scope.
4. If a pipeline needs early exit or complex error recovery, use a native
   short-circuit primitive or a local loop with pure helpers.
5. If repeated lambdas hide domain meaning, name the predicate/projector; do not
   pursue point-free style past debuggability.
6. Preserve context-manager lifetime, task cancellation, transaction scope, and
  concurrency bounds across lazy or async refactors.

## Validation Focus

Test empty, large, one-shot iterator, and exception-producing inputs. Verify
whether callers require a list, reusable iterable, or lazy iterator. Measure
peak memory before claiming a streaming improvement.

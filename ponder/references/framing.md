# Framing: from question to leaves

Use this scaffold whenever the probe stays open. Compose its moves into a frame
around governing mechanisms; most queries mix several modes.

## Ready frame

Build every field before registering leaves:

- scope: time, place, jurisdiction, version, population, workload, platform,
  and stakeholder boundaries that can change the answer;
- premises: every embedded factual or causal claim marked for confirmation or
  refutation;
- modes: factual, causal, normative, interpretive, feasibility, or
  implementation claims separated where their evidence and warrants differ;
- mechanisms: the laws, incentives, protocols, physical processes, or cost
  drivers that decide the question;
- evidence routes: the expected artifact and source class, using the class
  definitions in the spine, for each retrievable claim;
- rival: the strongest plausible premise or account that could reverse the
  emerging answer;
- leaves: 3-10 independent questions, each settled by one retrieval act.

For critical ambiguity, ask one focused question. If clarification is
unavailable, branch each plausible reading and use the branch point as Boundary
material. Put dependent sub-questions in the derived chain.

## Framing moves

Apply each contributing move in order. Re-run `clarify` when evidence exposes a
new interpretation.

| Move | Trigger | Product |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `clarify` | Two readings invoke different mechanisms or evidence | One user question, or explicit branches |
| `bind-scope` | The answer changes across context | Named dimensions and boundaries |
| `audit-premise` | The query embeds a statistic, history, comparison, or causal claim | A premise leaf that may close `refuted` |
| `split-modes` | Facts, causes, values, interpretations, feasibility, or implementation are mixed | Separate claims with separate warrants |
| `name-mechanisms` | Topic nouns conceal what determines the answer | Governing principles and cost drivers |
| `bridge-vocabulary` | The idea may exist under specialist terminology | Search terms and prior-art families |
| `route-evidence` | A claim lacks a natural retrieval target | Expected artifact and source class |
| `pose-rival` | The strongest contrary account lives outside the query's own premises | The rival field, with a leaf that may close `refuted` |
| `compile-leaves` | Scope and mechanisms are stable | Independent, retrievable leaf questions |

A ready frame groups by mechanism, assigns dependent conclusions to the derived
chain, and names evidence that could refute each premise.

## Completion checks

Before handing the frame back to `explore`, verify:

- every critical ambiguous term is resolved or branched;
- every embedded premise supports a `refuted` close while the frame remains valid;
- factual, causal, normative, interpretive, feasibility, and implementation
  claims use distinct warrants where needed;
- every leaf names one governing mechanism and one plausible evidence route;
- leaves are independent, jointly cover the material question, and use
  mechanism-level names;
- the rival premise and answer-flipping boundaries are explicit.

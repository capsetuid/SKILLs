# Craft: interaction

## Principles worth applying correctly

Cite these only where they apply.

* **Targets**: acquisition difficulty rises as targets get smaller and
  farther away. Frequent actions get large, close targets. Screen edges and
  corners are effectively infinite in depth and are premium real estate.
* **Choices**: decision time rises with the number and complexity of
  options. Reduce, group, order by frequency, and default. Ten equally
  weighted options is a harder screen than three plus a disclosure.
* **Convention**: users form expectations from every other interface they
  use. Departing from convention costs comprehension and must buy something
  real.
* **Conservation of complexity**: the irreducible complexity of a task goes
  somewhere. Put it in the system.
* **Response threshold**: interactions completing within roughly four tenths
  of a second preserve the sense of direct manipulation. Past that the user
  notices waiting and attention starts to drift.
* **Memory**: recognition is cheap, recall is expensive. Show the options.
* **Beauty bias**: attractive interfaces are rated as more usable and their
  problems go unreported. Test the interaction separately from its visual
  polish.

## The complete state set

Every interactive element:

| State | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Rest | Affordance is visible without hover. |
| Hover | Pointer only. Provide its information and actions through another channel. |
| Focus-visible | Always present, never suppressed, high contrast, not clipped. Obscuring rules are in `a11y`. |
| Active | Immediate acknowledgment at press, before any network work begins. |
| Disabled | Rare, and always explained. Prefer enabled with an explanation on attempt. |
| Loading | In place, with the label preserved so the control does not resize. |
| Error | Adjacent, specific, and actionable. |
| Success | Perceptible, then quiet. |

Every data container ships six states. Treat these as six different screens.
Independent boolean flags cannot express them: flags admit loading together
with error, and cannot distinguish "none exist" from "none match the
filter". Encode them as one closed set, so that omitting a state fails the
build.

<directives for="container-states">
  | { status: 'loading' }
  | { status: 'error'; error: LoadError; retry: () => void }
  | { status: 'empty' }                                  // none exist yet
  | { status: 'filtered'; clearFilter: () => void }      // none match
  | { status: 'partial'; items: Item[]; loadMore: () => void }
  | { status: 'ready'; items: Item[] }
</directives>

`empty` and `filtered` are the pair most often collapsed into one, and they
need different copy and different actions.

## Latency

| Elapsed | Design response |
| --- | --- |
| Under 100ms | Nothing. Show the result. |
| 100ms to 400ms | Nothing but the result. A loader here flashes and reads as a glitch. |
| 400ms to 1s | Local, in-place indication at the point of action. |
| 1s to 10s | Determinate progress, the rest of the interface still usable. |
| Over 10s | Move to background, release the user, notify on completion. |

Delay the appearance of any loader so fast responses never flash one, and
once shown, hold it briefly so it does not flicker out. Skeletons mirror the
real layout's dimensions. Optimistic updates apply to reversible actions
with an honest rollback; never fake success for something that can fail
permanently.

## Error philosophy

1. **Prevent.** Constrain input so the invalid value cannot be entered.
   Supply the correct default. Make the destructive action non-adjacent to
   the frequent one.
2. **Tolerate.** Parse what the user meant. Accept pasted values with
   spaces, separators, and surrounding characters. Trim. Correct case.
3. **Recover.** Preserve everything the user entered, place the message next
   to the cause, name the fix, and move focus to the first failure.
4. **Explain.** State what happened, what it means, and the next action
   instead of exposing a raw fault code alone. Keep technical detail
   available but secondary.

Accept input that is correct but differently formatted. Preserve form data
after failure and reuse information the system already has.

## Destructive actions

* Reversible: perform it immediately and offer undo for a meaningful window.
  This is faster and safer than a confirmation, because confirmations are
  dismissed reflexively.
* Irreversible: confirm, naming the exact object and the exact consequence,
  with a verb on the confirming button. For the catastrophic, require a
  deliberate act such as typing the name.
* Place destructive actions away from frequent actions and away from the
  default focused control.

## Keyboard and assistive access

* Every pointer action has a keyboard path. Everything focusable is
  reachable in a logical order matching the visual order.
* Focus moves into a dialog on open, stays within it, and returns to the
  trigger on close. Escape closes anything dismissible.
* Background content behind a modal is made inert.
* Keep the focused control fully clear of sticky headers, footers, and
  floating panels. `a11y` records which part of this is the floor and which
  is house practice above it.
* Provide a skip link past repeated navigation.
* Announce asynchronous changes through a live region, politely for status
  and assertively only for genuine urgency.
* Any drag interaction has a non-drag alternative, since dragging is
  unavailable to many users.
* Replace any removed outline with a focus style at least as visible.
  Suppressed focus is the most common accessibility defect.

## Continuity

* URL reflects state: record, tab, filter, sort, page, and search.
* Make Back do what the user expects and preserve work.
* Scroll position and expansion state survive navigation and return.
* Drafts persist across refresh and failure.
* Persist preferences, including density, dismissed guidance, and an
  explicit theme toggle where `color` calls for one. Keep dismissed guidance
  dismissed.
* Reuse information already provided and preserve authentication flows that
  depend on password managers or paste.

## Failure modes

* The happy path shipped alone, so the first real user with slow network or
  empty data sees an unstyled void.
* A spinner for a response that arrives in eighty milliseconds.
* Confirmation dialogs on safe actions, teaching users to dismiss dialogs
  without reading, so the one dangerous confirmation is also dismissed.
* Validation firing on the first keystroke, telling users their half-typed
  entry is invalid.
* Actions revealed only on hover, invisible to touch and keyboard.
* Toasts carrying information the user must act on, in the corner, briefly.
* A modal opened from a modal.

# Craft: color

Color carries the least information and attracts the most attention. Design
the interface in grayscale first; color cannot fix a hierarchy that does not
already read.

## Structure

* **One accent.** A single color means action, selection, and focus. Once
  chosen, it holds across every screen. A second accent appearing in one
  section is the most common consistency failure and reads as a bug. Where a
  system is supplied, this means one *declared* accent honored exactly: a
  declared accent plus reserved secondary hues is consistent when used as
  declared, and inconsistent the moment a component invents another value.
* **One neutral family**, consistently warm or cool. Mixing warm and cool
  greys in one surface creates a subtle mismatch that users perceive even if
  they cannot name it.
* **Semantic colors** for success, warning, danger, and information, each
  distinguishable from the accent and from each other. Danger must never be
  the accent, or destructive actions stop reading as destructive.
* Keep saturation restrained for large areas and reserve full saturation for
  small, deliberate emphasis. A saturated field fatigues; a saturated
  twelve-pixel dot informs.

## Tokens, not values

Name by role. A token called `surface-raised` survives a theme change; one
called `grey-100` becomes wrong when the theme inverts. Roles worth having:
page and raised surfaces, primary, secondary, and disabled text, subtle and
strong borders, the accent plus its hover, active, and subtle variants, the
semantic set, and a focus ring.

Author in a perceptually uniform color space where the toolchain supports
it, so that a lightness step means the same visual change at every hue.
Derive hover and active states by adjusting lightness within the space, and
let the platform's color mixing do the derivation so the relationship
survives a token change.

## Both themes, from the start

Design light and dark together. Retrofitting a theme produces the
characteristic result where one mode is designed and the other is inverted.

* Use near-black and near-white for large surfaces. Pure black kills depth
  and causes smearing on some displays; pure white glares.
* Dark mode is not an inversion. Elevation reverses: raised surfaces get
  lighter, and shadows do less work, so borders and surface lightness carry
  elevation instead.
* Saturated colors vibrate against dark backgrounds. Reduce saturation and
  raise lightness for accents in dark mode.
* Hierarchy parity is the requirement: whatever draws the eye first in light
  draws it first in dark.
* Select between theme values through the platform's own single-declaration
  mechanism, so the interface tracks the operating system preference live as
  the user changes it.
* **Default to the system preference and store nothing.** Ship no
  `light | dark | system` setting, no persisted choice, and no app-level
  theme state unless the user asks for a toggle.
* Add a toggle when the user asks for one, or when a mode loses meaningful
  brand expression. Default it to the system preference and persist that
  choice per `interaction`.

## Contrast in practice

Thresholds, exemptions, and their interpretation are the floor and are owned
by `a11y`. Compute every ratio; estimates and a supplied document's claims
are unverified.

* Style placeholder, helper, disabled-looking, and secondary text to read as
  secondary, then measure each against every surface it appears on,
  including tinted cards.
* An accent that fails at body size often passes at display size, so decide
  where a brand color may carry text before committing it to a button.
* Text over imagery needs a guaranteed backing: a scrim, a gradient, or a
  solid panel. Contrast against an image's average color is not contrast
  against the pixels behind the letters.
* Color is never the only channel. Pair it with text, icon, weight, or
  position.
* Keep forced-colors and high-contrast modes functional.

## Choosing a palette

Let the brand, domain, and audience choose. When nothing constrains the
choice, avoid the reflexive families of generated design: the purple-to-blue
technology gradient, and the warm cream with brass and oxblood that appears
on every artisan and premium consumer brief. Both are defaults, and they
make distinct brands look identical.

Choose a direction that is coherent and unusual for the category: a
saturated single hue against one neutral, a deep natural tone with a warm
accent, sharp near-black against a warm mid-tone, or true monochrome with
one bright accent. Rotate across projects; shipping the same palette twice
within a category means the palette came from habit.

## Failure modes

* An accent chosen for the button, then a different one for links, then a
  third for charts.
* Grey text lightened until it looks refined and fails contrast.
* Semantic colors indistinguishable from the accent, so nothing reads as an
  alert.
* A dark theme built by inverting lightness, leaving shadows invisible and
  accents vibrating.
* Gradients used to add interest to a composition that lacks hierarchy.

# Craft: platform

Reach for the platform before a dependency. Native capability arrives with
accessibility, keyboard behavior, and top-layer rendering already correct,
without adding dependency code to the bundle.

Browser support moves continuously and this file ages. Before relying on any
capability below, verify its current baseline status yourself against the
project's stated support targets, and provide a graceful fallback when the
feature is progressive rather than essential.

## Choosing the layer

1. **A native element** whose semantics match: the button, the disclosure,
   the dialog, the label bound to its input, the ordered list. Get its
   semantics and behavior for free.
2. **A platform API** for behavior: top-layer overlays, transitions between
   states or documents, scroll-linked progress, anchored positioning.
3. **CSS** for anything visual or state-driven that CSS can express.
4. **A dependency**, only when the above cannot express it, and only one per
   concern.

Style the native control; a rebuild gains little styling and keeps the
accessibility and keyboard issues.

## Capabilities worth knowing

**Overlays and layering.** The platform provides real top-layer rendering
for dialogs and lightweight popovers, including backdrop styling, escape
dismissal, focus handling, and light dismissal, plus anchored positioning
that tethers an element to a reference without measurement code. Use these
before installing a positioning or modal dependency.

**Transitions.** Same-document and cross-document view transitions animate
between two states or two pages, including shared-element continuity,
without manual measurement. Entry animation for elements arriving in the DOM
and animation of discrete properties are both expressible in CSS.

**Scroll-linked animation.** Scroll progress and element-in-view progress
are available as CSS timelines that run off the main thread. Prefer these
over observers for pure visual effects, and observers over event listeners
in every case.

**Responsive to context, not viewport.** Size and style queries let a
component respond to its own container, so one component works in a sidebar,
a modal, and a full-width region without breakpoint duplication. Relative
units tied to the container let type and spacing scale with context.

**Selection and relational styling.** Parent-, sibling-, and
state-relational selectors express in one rule what previously required
state plumbing through the component tree.

**Color.** Perceptually uniform color spaces, color mixing, and single
declarations that select per theme let a palette be derived from a small
number of source values.

**Typography.** Line balancing for headings, orphan avoidance for body,
trimming of font-metric whitespace for exact optical spacing, and control of
digit forms are all native.

**Form ergonomics.** Native validity states distinguish "invalid" from
"invalid after the user has interacted", the distinction that prevents
validating a half-typed field. Fields can size to their content. The
platform styles selection colors and control accents directly.

**Rendering and inertness.** Content can be marked inert for interaction and
assistive technology, and offscreen content can be skipped during rendering
for large documents.

## Framework posture

Match the repository. When choosing for greenfield work:

* Render as much as possible statically or on the server, and treat
  interactivity as isolated leaves. Every interactive boundary adds client
  work for every user.
* Handle asynchronous state with the framework's own mechanisms for pending
  state, optimistic updates, and form submission; hand-rolled loading flags
  are where missing loading and error states come from.
* Stream what can be streamed. Showing a usable shell immediately beats
  showing nothing until everything resolves.
* Add an animation library when the interaction genuinely needs
  interruptible, physics-based, or gesture-driven motion. Use platform
  reveals and transitions for simpler interactions.
* Use one animation system per component tree; two compete for the same
  frames.

## Performance targets

One vendor's product thresholds, revisable by that vendor, carrying none of
the regulatory weight of the accessibility floor. Never trade a criterion in
`a11y` against one of these. Treat them as design constraints, and re-verify
the values when they matter.

* Largest contentful paint under 2.5 seconds. The hero image or heading is
  prioritized and not blocked by a font request or a client bundle.
* Interaction to next paint under 200 milliseconds. Heavy work moves off the
  main thread or gets chunked.
* Cumulative layout shift under 0.1. Everything asynchronous has reserved
  space and fonts are metric-matched.

Budget the bundle before writing it. Lazy-load anything below the fold, and
weigh any dependency against the number of users who incur its cost on every
visit.

## Failure modes

* Installing a positioning, modal, or animation dependency for behavior the
  platform now provides natively.
* Using a capability without verifying support against the project's stated
  targets, and without a fallback.
* Building a custom control to get custom styling, then shipping it without
  its keyboard and assistive contract.
* Marking a whole page as interactive because one element in it is.
* Treating performance targets as a post-launch audit.

# Craft: typography

Type is the interface. It carries most of the hierarchy, most of the voice,
and most of the reading effort. Get it right before touching color.

## The scale

Fix one scale and use only its steps; six to eight steps covers almost every
interface. A ratio near 1.2 suits dense product interfaces; near 1.333 suits
marketing surfaces where display type does expressive work.

Set the scale in a relative unit so it honors the user's browser text size.
Fixed pixel sizing for body text overrides an explicit accessibility
preference.

## Measure and rhythm

* Body measure between roughly 45 and 75 characters. Wider loses the line
  return; narrower fragments phrases.
* Line height inverse to size: generous for body text, tightening as display
  size grows, near or slightly above 1 only at the largest display sizes.
* Line height and spacing scale should share a rhythm so text blocks align
  to the same grid as everything else.
* Paragraph spacing separates; first-line indentation is for continuous
  prose. Use exactly one of the two.
* Tighten letter spacing slightly as size increases; loosen it for uppercase
  and for small text. Letterspace uppercase and small text only.

## Choosing faces

Two families is the working maximum: one for text, one for display or
monospace. Three requires a reason you can state.

Choose for the job. A face for an operator console needs unambiguous digits,
distinguishable I/l/1 and O/0, and a true monospace companion for numbers
and identifiers. A face for an editorial surface needs a real italic and
sufficient weight range. Verify the family actually ships the weights and
the true italic being used before designing around them.

**Serif discipline.** Reaching for a serif because it feels premium,
creative, or considered is the most common type misjudgment in generated
design. Use a serif when the surface is editorial, literary, or heritage, or
when the brand specifies one. Be able to say why that particular serif suits
that particular brand. Otherwise choose a display sans, the common default
in contemporary brand work.

**Emphasis stays in the family.** Emphasize a word inside a heading with the
weight or the italic of the same family.

**Rotate faces.** Reusing the same two or three fashionable faces across
every project produces a house style nobody asked for. If the last
comparable surface used a face, choose differently unless the brand requires
it.

## Setting text well

* Balance headings so the last line is not a single orphaned word, and set
  body text to avoid single-word final lines. The platform has properties
  for both; prefer them to manual line breaks, which break at other
  viewports.
* Use a hard break in a heading only when the shape survives every viewport.
* Italic descenders clip against tight line heights. Any italic at display
  size needs line height above 1 and reserved space below.
* Use real typographic quotation marks and apostrophes, real ellipses, and
  proper fractions where the face provides them.
* Numbers in tables, timers, and anything that updates use tabular figures
  so digits do not shift.
* Uppercase runs longer than a few words lose word shape and slow reading.
  Reserve uppercase for short labels.

## Delivery

* Self-host or use the framework's font pipeline. Keep third-party
  stylesheet requests off the first-paint path.
* Serve variable fonts when a range of weights is in use; one variable file
  usually costs less than three static cuts.
* Subset to the character sets actually needed.
* Swap to a fallback during load, and tune the fallback's metrics so the
  swap does not shift layout. Untuned font fallback is a top cause of layout
  instability.
* Preload only the faces used above the fold.

## Failure modes

* A scale with many near-identical steps produces hierarchy nobody can
  perceive and inconsistency everybody can.
* Display type set at a size chosen before the headline was written; the
  headline then wraps to four lines and the composition breaks.
* Grey body text chosen for elegance that fails contrast at the size it is
  set.
* Two faces that are too similar to read as a pairing and too different to
  read as one voice.
* Weight used as the only hierarchy signal in a face whose weights are close
  together.

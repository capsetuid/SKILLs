# Verb: teach

Explain a design decision so the reader can make the next one without
asking. Calibrate to the audience; never lecture.

## Calibration

| Audience | Lead with | Avoid |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Engineer | The rule, the token, the failure it prevents | Art vocabulary without a mechanism |
| Designer | The principle and the precedent | Restating fundamentals they hold |
| Product or founder | The user outcome and the cost of the alternative | Craft vocabulary as justification |
| Mixed or unknown | The user outcome, then the mechanism | Assuming shared vocabulary |

## Structure

1. **The decision**, stated in one sentence.
2. **The user consequence**: what changes for the person using this, said
   concretely, without quality adjectives.
3. **The mechanism**: why this produces that consequence. Name the principle
   if a real one applies, and name it accurately.
4. **The counterfactual**: what the common alternative would have caused.
   This is the part that transfers.
5. **The boundary**: when this decision would be wrong. Every design rule
   has a domain; a rule taught without its domain becomes cargo cult.

## Rules

* Teach the reasoning behind the ruling. "Sixteen pixels" is a ruling.
  "Anything a finger targets needs a comfortable, forgiving hit area, and
  smaller than this measurably raises mis-taps" is reasoning that transfers.
* Cite a principle only when it applies and you can state it correctly.
  Misapplied laws of interaction are worse than no citation, because the
  reader will repeat the error with confidence.
* Show one before-and-after, one snippet, or one described comparison.
* Match length to the question. A question about one radius value gets three
  sentences.
* Admit taste when it is taste. Some decisions are defensible preference
  inside a coherent system, and saying so builds more trust than a
  rationalization.
* Never defend a wrong decision. Correct it plainly and teach the corrected
  version.

# AGENTS.md

This repository is a central, project-agnostic library of reusable agent
skills. Each skill is a self-contained `SKILL.md` describing a procedure an
LLM agent can load and execute. Downstream projects consume it as a git
submodule mounted at `.github/skills`, as a Claude Code plugin, or through a
skills manager such as `npx skills`, so **every skill here MUST be neutral
and reusable across unrelated projects**. Load linked skills only when a
task needs them.

## Repository shape

* One directory per skill, named in kebab-case, containing a file named
  exactly `SKILL.md`. The directory name MUST match the skill's `name` in
  its frontmatter.
* Naming convention: a task skill is an imperative verb phrase, the command
  a user would speak (`fact-check`, `read-pdf`, `git-commit`); a persona or
  stance skill is a single noun (`caveman`, `ponytail`, `pl-theorist`). No
  filler nouns (`-protocol`, `-helper`, `-skills`), no gerunds.
* Every top-level directory that is neither dotted nor `skills/` IS a skill
  directory; that namespace is reserved. Repository plumbing lives in dotted
  directories (`.github`, `.claude`, `.claude-plugin`, `.agents`) or in
  single files at the root (e.g. `sync-skills.example.yml`).
* `skills/` is the vendor-neutral hub: one committed relative symlink per
  skill, `skills/<skill-name>` to `../<skill-name>`. Every vendor path is
  one symlink to that hub, so another agent costs one link. `.github/skills`
  serves GitHub Copilot and mirrors the path downstream projects mount this
  repository at; `.claude/skills` serves Claude Code; `.agents/skills`
  serves OpenAI Codex.
* `.claude-plugin/` carries the installer manifests: `marketplace.json`
  lists every skill by its canonical root path, the address installers
  resolve, and `plugin.json` declares the same root container to Claude
  Code. The gate regenerates that list from the tree, so adding a skill
  never edits a manifest by hand.
* `LICENSE`: MIT.
* This repository is documentation that other agents read; correctness is an
  editorial property. The exception is the bundled Python, a uv workspace:
  the root `pyproject.toml` lists every member, `uv.lock` pins the whole
  library, and the gate lints, formats, and tests it (see Automated gate).

Each skill loads its reference files on demand from `references/`.

Current skills:

* `advisor/` - a principal investigator's read of a research project:
  constitution as every origin with each mechanism tagged as-is, tweaked,
  transferred, or new and its patterns named, each setup element classed
  current, legacy, or toy with a source, the lab's envelope written as an
  assumption, one instrument and one kill test per claim, and verbs review,
  design, audit, teach, help.
* `aesthete/` - UI design and review with an HCI eye: design read,
  composition dials, precedence ladder, ownership table, a dated WCAG 2.2
  accessibility floor, verbs
  (design/build/refactor/review/audit/teach/help), surface profiles, craft
  references, and a generated-output tell catalogue.
* `author-skill/` - how to distill a procedure into a reproducible skill;
  the meta-skill governing this repository.
* `caveman/` - token-economical output with lite/full/ultra/wenyan levels
  and commit/review/refactor/stats/help verbs; refactor is guarded by a
  script.
* `fact-check/` - atomic-claim verification against retrieved evidence:
  calibrated verdicts, evidence-first reports, tiered approval before edits,
  one delegate per claim through summon.
* `git-commit/` - Conventional Commits with lite/full/ultra effort levels
  and a push verb.
* `humanize/` - claim-preserving rewrites of AI-sounding prose: 40-pattern
  detection index (Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing" plus Claude-specific
  tells), invariants, progressive loading, calibration guard.
* `lit-review/` - staged literature reviews with a search script over
  OpenAlex, arXiv, and Crossref: criteria before search, logged queries,
  deduplication, two-pass screening, snowballing, extraction, a gated
  notebook of findings and gaps, DOI and citation checks.
* `peer-review/` - adverse, referenced paper review: verbatim claims,
  signalling-question banks for design, analysis, limitations, and novelty,
  a lit-review corpus for prior work, objections admitted only with a
  resolved quote or a dated corpus key, and a derived recommendation.
* `pl-theorist/` - a PL theorist's discipline via verbs
  (design/build/refactor/review/audit/test/teach/help) with per-language
  cost models, Bash and GitHub Actions YAML included.
* `ponder/` - open-question research with uniform rigor: lead-run first
  round, decomposition to retrievable leaves, a script-owned event ledger,
  fan-out over orthogonal bundles, a mandatory rival sweep, presentation
  derived from ledger state.
* `ponytail/` - laziest-working-solution discipline: YAGNI, stdlib first,
  minimal diffs; lite/full/ultra levels and
  design/refactor/review/audit/test/teach/debt/stats/help verbs.
* `read-pdf/` - text and metadata extraction from PDF files or URLs; URLs
  download once into a capped temp cache.
* `reframe/` - testable target-direction judgments that challenge
  incremental or legacy-bound framing.
* `search-web/` - retrieval for an agent with no harness search tool: ranked
  web results, instant answers, Wikipedia summaries, papers with DOIs, and
  the readable text of one page, all in one record shape.
* `setup-env/` - isolated per-project dev environments in userspace with uv
  as the only assumption: a typed target algebra of
  `family[:flavor][@version]` tags, micromamba and publisher suppliers, qemu
  user-mode emulation, a typed planner under `scripts/`.
* `summon/` - delegation to another agent: an inline-first mode ladder, a
  six-field brief, a reach ladder for getting a skill into a delegate,
  fanout bundles that name the neighbouring territory, returns treated as
  untrusted and judged against their contract, a cross-harness table, and
  the caller protocol every other skill delegates through (the caller
  supplies unit, record, rules, return shape, cap, and gate; the lead is the
  sole writer).
* `thematic-analysis/` - theme development from qualitative text under one
  named school (reflexive, codebook, template, framework matrix, rapid,
  hybrid), with corpus-sourced defaults, a feedback-data adaptation
  disclosure, and its cited evidence base.

## Automated gate

`.github/workflows/gate.yml` runs on every push to `main` and on manual
dispatch. It repairs what is mechanical, commits the repair to `main` as one
GitHub-signed `style:` commit, and fails only on findings no fixer can
settle. Run the same fixers before pushing and the gate has nothing to do:

```bash
ruff check --fix . && ruff format .
uv run --all-packages pytest
uv run --project .github/gate btm-repo-gate fix
```

| Repaired automatically | Reported for a human |
| --- | --- |
| ruff's safe lint fixes and formatting (policy in `ruff.toml`) | Lint findings ruff cannot fix safely |
| A missing, wrong, orphaned, or legacy-shaped hub or vendor alias | A skill directory with no `SKILL.md` |
| Frontmatter `name`, `license`, or field-order drift | Frontmatter judgments: a missing or overlong description, non-spec fields, descriptions totalling over the budget |
| Manifest `name` fields and the declared skill list | A missing or unreadable plugin manifest |
| Skill entries out of alphabetical order in this file and `README.md` | A skill missing from either list, or an entry naming no skill |
| Markdown prose off the 76-column wrap; code, tables, and markup keep their width | |
| | An alias path occupied by real content, which no repair may destroy |
| | An em-dash (U+2014), whose replacement is a judgment |
| | Skill Python outside its `scripts/` member, or a manifest off `scripts/pyproject.toml` |
| | A workspace member whose Python redefines a kernel symbol |

Rules live in `.github/gate/src/btm_repo_gate/rules/`, one function each. A
rule returns findings, and a finding carries its repair or `None`; that
field alone decides which column above it lands in, so adding a rule never
touches the driver or the workflow. Never silence a ruff rule
repository-wide: put a `# noqa: RULE` carrying its reason on the line that
earns it.

## Frontmatter protocol

Every `SKILL.md` header conforms strictly to the [Agent
Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard, so a skill loads unchanged in
any spec-compliant agent and uploads without hard errors:

* Fields, in canonical order: `name`, `description`, then only as needed
  `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`, `allowed-tools`. NEVER emit
  agent-specific extension fields (`argument-hint`, `when_to_use`, ...);
  record such hints as quoted string values under `metadata` (e.g.
  `metadata: {argument-hint: "[lite|full|ultra]"}`).
* `name` equals the directory name: 1-64 characters; lowercase letters,
  numbers, and hyphens; no leading, trailing, or consecutive hyphens.
* `description` is a `>-` folded block scalar, ≤1024 characters, third
  person, in two movements: what the skill does (capability statement
  carrying its key search terms), then trigger conditions starting "Use when
  ...". Routing to a confusable sibling lives in the body's `## Redirects`
  section, never here. Every description sits in context whether or not the
  skill runs, so it carries the deliverable and the one or two guarantees
  the reader can hold the skill to ("cites only what it retrieved", "edits
  nothing without approval"), in the reader's vocabulary, and nothing about
  how: no internal record, phase, or file the body defines, no library the
  skill calls, no verb or level that `argument-hint` already lists. Target
  100 to 150 tokens. All descriptions together stay under the gate's
  7,000-character budget: Codex gives the whole skill list 8,000 characters
  and shortens descriptions first.
* `metadata.argument-hint` is the invocation grammar and the only place it
  is spelled: one bracket group per independent choice, ordered as a user
  types them, so orthogonal axes never collapse into one alternation
  (`"[lite|full|ultra] [design|review|help]"`, never
  `"[lite|full|ultra|design|review|help]"`, which reads as pick exactly
  one). Every skill carries one; a skill with no vocabulary names its
  subject instead (`"[file-or-section]"`). No check can derive this from the
  body, since verbs, levels, and modes are declared in different shapes per
  skill and nowhere authoritatively, so it is a review obligation whenever a
  verb, level, or mode changes.
* `license: MIT` on every skill; skills are vendored individually and keep
  their terms when copied out of this repository.
* `compatibility` (≤500 characters) only for real environment requirements
  (runtimes, system packages, network access); most skills omit it.

## Authoring and editing skills

* Before creating or modifying any skill, load
  [author-skill/SKILL.md](author-skill/SKILL.md) and follow it. It defines
  the required structure, the distillation workflow, the validation
  checklist, and the full rules for bundled scripts (its scripts
  directives).
* A skill MUST be a reproducible procedure, never a narrative of one past
  session, and MUST NOT hardcode any single project's identity (paths,
  scopes, service or package names). Parameterize project-specific values or
  instruct the agent to derive them from the consuming repository.
* Keep each skill within context economy (~500 lines). Offload bulky
  reference material to sibling files the agent reads on demand.
* When a step uses a capability another skill in this library provides (PDF
  extraction, commit drafting, prose cleanup, environment provisioning),
  command that skill in its slash form as an unconditional instruction:
  "read PDFs with `/read-pdf`". The slash marks a skill invocation, and the
  imperative holds because the library is consumed as a set, so siblings are
  present. A fallback chain responds to conditions of the environment (an
  unreachable file, no network) and names the degraded path to take.
* The body opens with one paragraph under the title, one to three sentences
  stating what the skill does and delivers, naming no sibling.
* A skill's redirects, the tasks that belong to a sibling or lie outside the
  skill, sit in one `## Redirects` section directly after `## Registry`
  (first, when the skill bundles no files; absent, when it has no
  redirects): one bullet per task, the condition, a colon, then the sibling
  in slash form or, with no sibling, the plain action to take instead, so
  the model keeps working. Route per verb from the spine where two personas
  pair verb for verb ("`/pl-theorist`, same verb"). Keep a mid-procedure
  command of a sibling ("extract the paper with `/read-pdf`") in the
  procedure.
* A skill that hands work to another agent commands `/summon` and supplies
  only what summon's caller table asks for: the unit one delegate closes,
  the record it hands over, the rules of its own that unit can break, its
  return shape by registered name, its cap, and the gate the lead admits the
  return through. Mode, brief shape, bounds, sizing, trust, and the review
  of a return are summon's; a skill restates none of them and carries no
  worker prompt, delegation threshold, or cost figure of its own.
* Write directives, not commentary about the document. A sentence that
  explains why a convention exists, restates a table's headings, or narrates
  the file's structure is paid for on every load. Keep rationale only where
  it changes a judgment call.
* State each directive as the pattern to follow. A prohibition spells out
  the unwanted pattern in full, which raises its salience for the reading
  model; the positive form spends the same tokens on the right path. Reserve
  negation for hard boundaries where the banned form must be named to be
  recognized (secrets, em-dashes, spec violations).
* Bundled files are addressed by **registered name**, never by path, so a
  path cannot drift and two files cannot claim one name:
  * **One declaration site, declared before use.** Every skill that bundles
    files opens with a `## Registry` section, the first `##` heading in the
    file, mapping each name to its path. That table is the only place a path
    appears. It lists every bundled file, including any not loaded during a
    run, such as a maintainer protocol; those say so in their own first
    line.
  * **A name is the basename without `.md`, in backticks**: `` `a11y` ``, ``
    `interaction` ``. Backticks mark an identifier, so it is never read as
    the ordinary word. Basenames are unique within a skill.
  * **Everything outside the declaration uses the name alone**, in
    `SKILL.md` and inside `references/` alike. Reference files MUST NOT
    contain Markdown links to other reference files: the spec keeps
    references one level deep from `SKILL.md`, and link syntax invites the
    chaining that rule forbids.
  * **State the name-is-the-file identity once, never per row.** When a
    table is keyed by verb, mode, or level and each row loads the file of
    that name, say so in one sentence above the table and drop the column.
    Rows that deviate (loading nothing, or loading two files) are named in
    that same sentence.
  * **A name is an address, never a sentence's payload.** It appears as the
    object of a word that says what it is: "defined in `review`", "load
    `brief`", "the template in `report`". Never "Full format: `review`.",
    which reads as a value. In a table cell the column heading supplies that
    word.
  * **Runnable commands keep the literal path**, since they are invocations.
  * A citation names the file that owns the topic. When ownership moves,
    every citation to it moves in the same change.
* NEVER use em-dash characters (U+2014) anywhere in this repository; use a
  hyphen, a comma, a colon, or restructure the sentence.
* Markdown prose wraps at 76 columns. The gate reflows paragraphs and list
  items to that width and leaves frontmatter, code, tables, and XML blocks
  as written, so wrap by hand only for reading comfort while drafting.
* A convention change is total: the same change rewrites every statement,
  example, and docstring of the old convention, so the repository shows one
  convention at a time.
* A bundled script and its invoking agent form a neuro-symbolic pair; the
  scripts directives in author-skill govern the split (exact invariants in
  the script, advisory signals for heuristics, witness-gated destruction,
  script-minted identifiers, uniform command surfaces, stdin JSON, the uv
  workspace member layout under `scripts/`, the `btm-corekit` kernel, the
  documented `R=` binding, and the request-origin convention). The gate
  keeps the kernel single-defined and the layout canonical: a member that
  redefines a kernel symbol, skill Python outside `scripts/`, or a manifest
  off `<skill>/scripts/pyproject.toml` is a blocking finding.
* A script is frugal with the user's disk, and its state placement follows
  the XDG base directory standard:
  * Durable, light state (backups, logs, resumable sessions) lives in the
    library's one state root under the XDG state directory:
    `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/btm-skills/`
    (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\btm-skills\` on Windows). The `btm-skills` segment
    marks this library as the source of every file under it, and each script
    keeps all of its durable files inside its own skill's subdirectory of
    that root, `btm-skills/<skill-name>/`, in purpose-named subdirectories
    (`backups/`, `logs/`, `sessions/`).
  * Heavy or regenerable artifacts (downloads, toolchains, caches,
    extractions) live in temporary space. Any temp location serves; the
    directory's name identifies its owner, the way `/setup-env` prefixes its
    roots with `denv`.
  * Logs are JSONL with one timestamped record per line and a size cap the
    script enforces at write time by trimming or one-step rotation.
  * Every script that writes state ships a `clean` verb that removes its
    state, one target or `--all`, and reports the bytes freed.
* All of a skill's Python, entry point included, lives inside its member:
  the member's `pyproject.toml` is the single source of truth for what it
  needs, and its console command is the only way in. Skills invoke that
  command with `uv run --project` through the documented binding, never with
  a host `python`/`python3` and never by module path.
* When adding or renaming a skill, create it at `<skill-name>/SKILL.md` in
  the repository root and update the skill lists in `AGENTS.md` and
  `README.md` in the same change. The gate writes the alias symlink and the
  manifest entry, so run it rather than hand-maintaining either.
* Edit skills **here**, in this repository. NEVER edit the vendored copy
  inside a downstream project's `.github/skills` submodule; those changes
  are discarded on the next submodule update.

## Persona verb protocol

A persona skill dispatches work through verbs. A persona implements, from
this table, the verbs its lens can honor, each with the table's contract;
`pl-theorist` and `ponytail` carry all eight:

| Verb | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| design | Plan before code exists |
| build | Write new code |
| refactor | Rewrite existing code, behavior preserved |
| review | Judge a change: total over the diff, sound areas named |
| audit | Judge a codebase: sampled by blast radius, unexamined areas named |
| test | Derive checks from the lens's own laws |
| teach | Explain a judgment, calibrated to audience |
| help | Quick-reference card |

Laws:

* `build` and `refactor` apply changes; every other verb is read-only.
* Same verb, same contract in every persona; only the lens differs.
* A read-only verb names what is outside its lens and routes it to the
  sibling skill in slash form.
* Dispatch precedence: explicit verb, then unambiguous request shape, then
  the persona's declared default verb.
* One verb file per invocation, registered under the verb's name.

Beyond the core the namespace is free (`ponytail` carries `debt` and
`stats`), and a verb name keeps one meaning across the library: core names
keep the table's semantics, and a name another skill already uses keeps that
skill's meaning. Levels are optional per persona; where present they are
`lite | full | ultra` meaning advise / enforce (default) / maximalist,
persist until changed, and stay orthogonal to verbs.

## Commit conventions

Follow [git-commit/SKILL.md](git-commit/SKILL.md): Conventional Commits,
imperative subject ≤70 characters, scope derived from the change (here, the
skill directory name, e.g. `feat(author-skill): ...`). Drop the scope for
repository-wide changes.

## How downstream projects consume this repository

Skills are added as a submodule:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/BTreeMap/SKILLs.git .github/skills
```

The default setup also hard-copies `sync-skills.example.yml` from this
repository's root to the consumer's `.github/workflows/sync-skills.yml`, so
the submodule pointer auto-bumps to the upstream tip on a schedule. The copy
MUST be a real file: GitHub Actions does not resolve symlinks under
`.github/workflows`.

Consumers clone with `--recurse-submodules` (or run
`git submodule update --init --recursive` on an existing checkout), and
refresh with `git submodule update --remote .github/skills` followed by
committing the bumped pointer. A change here reaches a project only after
that project bumps its submodule pointer.

For Claude Code and Codex discovery in a consuming repository, commit
relative parent-level aliases from `.claude/skills` and `.agents/skills` to
`../.github/skills`. A submodule cannot create those entries in its parent
repository. The root skill directories remain canonical; this repository's
`skills/` hub and its vendor aliases are relative symlinks.

## Boundaries

* NEVER add secrets, credentials, or project-internal data to a skill; these
  files are public and vendored verbatim into many repositories.
* NEVER make a skill depend on a specific language, framework, or directory
  layout unless the skill's whole purpose is that ecosystem, and say so in
  the `description`.
* When in doubt about a project-specific value, write the skill to discover
  it from the repository at runtime instead of assuming it.

## Types

Every bundled script is typechecked. `uv run mypy` runs strict over every
member's `src/`, with the pydantic plugin so a model's fields are checked at
authoring time, and the gate workflow fails on a finding. Domain records
subclass `Model` from the kernel, which is frozen and refuses unknown
fields; constrained strings use the kernel's refined aliases (`Slug`, `Doi`,
`ArxivId`, `Keyword`, `NonEmpty`) rather than bare `str`.

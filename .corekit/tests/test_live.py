"""Whether the real indexes still answer the way these decoders parse them.

A mock proves our half of the contract: given this body, the decoder yields
this record. It cannot prove the service still sends that body, and that is
the half that breaks without anyone editing this repository. So these ask
the services themselves, and assert on the fields the crossings depend on
rather than on a bare 200: a page of works whose every title is empty
parses perfectly and is still a broken decoder.

Advisory by construction. A third party rate-limiting or having an outage
is not this repository breaking, so the gate runs these without letting
them redden it.

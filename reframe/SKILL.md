description: >-
  Turns a design or planning discussion into a testable direction judgment:
  a thesis, the binding constraint, the target worth aiming at, what to stop
  doing, three costed routes from conservative to clean, and the evidence
  that would prove it wrong. Use when asked to think bigger, escape
  incrementalism, reconsider legacy constraints, or set direction, or when
  compatibility fear or refactor cost is deciding the target too early.

# Reframe

Open the decision frame before implementation gravity closes it, and deliver the decision horizon, system boundary, and target model. Strategic altitude is conceptual compression: fewer concepts, clearer ownership, longer-lived boundaries, higher leverage.

## Redirects

- Whether to do, kill, or defer the idea: give the call plainly from the evidence at hand; reframe only what proceeds
- Module boundaries, abstraction depth, or implementation quality: `/pl-theorist` or `/ponytail`
- Migration sequencing, rollout, observability, and rollback: plan them as ordinary engineering work once the target is accepted
- Writing the product requirements document: write it from the accepted target in the team's own format

After the target is accepted, route it to an available feasibility or landing procedure, or state the unresolved landing questions.

## Doctrine

<directives>

  <directives for="principles">
    <rule>Bold hypothesis, careful verification: treat the thesis as a high-leverage hypothesis, open the frame, make the call, then make it falsifiable before execution commitment.</rule>
    <rule>Separate the right target from the path used to reach it.</rule>
    <rule>Price compatibility, migration, and refactor cost before they choose the target unpriced.</rule>
    <rule>Prefer conceptual deletion and boundary repair over additive architecture.</rule>
    <rule>Calibrate confidence from evidence.</rule>
    <rule>Keep irreversible commitments behind the first discriminating proof point.</rule>
  </directives>
</directives>

## Trigger Gate

Invoke on explicit cues, including:

- "Think bigger," "raise the altitude," "step back," or "give me the big-picture call."
- "Too incremental," "too safe," "too conservative," or "stop optimizing locally."
- "Greenfield this," "ignore the legacy for a moment," or "what would we build today?"
- "Do not let compatibility or refactor difficulty dictate the direction."

Invoke proactively only when at least one symptom exists:

- A local patch is chosen before the target model is stated.
- Compatibility is preserved without a named contract or stakeholder.
- The current package, document, process, or partial implementation is treated as immutable.
- Migration size is used to reject a direction before its value is assessed.
- Many small concepts obscure one lifecycle, owner, or product promise.
- Proposed options differ in mechanics but preserve the same questionable frame.

A small proposal alone is not a trigger; it can be correct when the boundary, target, and evidence support it.

## Required Inputs

Derive from supplied material before asking questions:

- Decision to make.
- Outcome and useful time horizon.
- Current proposal or inherited model.
- Known contracts and stakeholders.
- Claimed constraints and supporting evidence.

Ask one focused question when a missing piece could change the target.
Otherwise continue and state the assumption.

If a repository or document set is available:

1. Search for public contracts, persisted schemas, integrations, callers, tests, migration code, and ownership boundaries.
2. Read representative definitions and call sites; avoid exhaustive archaeology before forming the thesis.
3. Inspect version history only when intent or compatibility status could change the decision.
4. Label every unsupported claim as an assumption.

If the outcome, horizon, boundary, or owner is missing, ask only when the answer could change the target model. Otherwise, state the assumption and lower confidence.

## Constraint Classification

Classify each inherited constraint before using it:

| Class | Evidence | Treatment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Contract | Public API, persisted data, documented integration, user promise, compliance rule, deployment limit, explicit instruction | Preserve, migrate deliberately, or renegotiate openly |
| Delivery constraint | Deadline, budget, staffing, rollout window, operational capacity | Price in the path; keep it out of the target architecture |
| Migration cost | Internal callers, relearning, diff size, temporary dual operation | Estimate and stage if justified; call it compatibility only with evidence |
| Inertia | Stale name, old package layout, partial implementation, document shape, "already built" | Remove from target reasoning |
| Unknown | Asserted constraint without inspectable evidence | Name the assumption; seek the cheapest deciding evidence |

Internal usage creates work; a contract needs evidence.

## Frame-Opening Moves

Select the smallest set that exposes the hidden decision. Use at least one; name it in the output.

| Move | Question | Guardrail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| End-state backcasting | If this were excellent at the chosen horizon, what would be true? | Backcast to the present and keep the architecture grounded |
| Zero-legacy thought experiment | With no old callers or names, what model would we choose? | Restore only constraints proven real |
| Kill the wrong concept | Which object, phase, section, or service encodes the wrong model? | Delete the concept, label and all |
| Ten-times stress | Which plausible 10x axis makes the model fail first? | Choose one relevant axis and scale only that axis |
| Constraint inversion | If this constraint vanished, what would change? | Decide whether removal cost is worth paying |
| Non-negotiable principles | Which two to four rules must the target never violate? | Use principles to decide |
| Boundary reset | Is responsibility split at the wrong system, lifecycle, or ownership boundary? | Move boundaries only when ownership becomes clearer |
| Tasteful deletion | What can stop existing without reducing the intended outcome? | Name the lost behavior and affected stakeholder |

## Workflow

### 1. Reframe the decision

State the real choice at the highest useful level. Define outcome, horizon, system boundary, and decision owner. Reject vague goals such as "cleaner" or "more scalable."

### 2. Establish the evidence baseline

Separate observed facts, explicit instructions, and assumptions. Record missing evidence only when it can change the decision.

### 3. Diagnose the inherited frame

Name the constraint currently controlling the proposal. Classify it using the constraint table. State who or what requires it. Grant contract status only when evidence names one.

### 4. Open the frame

Apply one or more frame-opening moves. Explain the newly visible option, boundary, deletion, or principle.

### 5. Form the clean target

Describe the end-state independently of migration:

- Core model and system boundary.
- Lifecycle owner and source of truth.
- Two to four non-negotiable principles.
- What survives.
- Kill list: what to delete, merge, split, rename, reframe, or rebuild.

### 6. Name what not to do

Identify safe-looking actions that block the target:

- Local optimizations that fix symptoms while preserving the wrong boundary.
- Permanent shims or dual models without a named contract and retirement condition.
- Detail work that does not reduce uncertainty or advance the target.

### 7. Compare three paths

Use the canonical options:

- **Conservative path**: preserve the inherited model; minimize immediate disruption.
- **Clean target**: move directly to the preferred end-state.
- **Staged clean path**: preserve the same clean target; sequence reversible steps and give every temporary bridge an owner, a removal trigger, and a deadline or measurable gate.

Compare target integrity, immediate price, permanent complexity, contract risk, and time to evidence. Recommend one. Choose Staged only when it preserves the clean target and has explicit retirement. If a path is incoherent, mark it non-viable.

### 8. Make the call

State material tradeoffs without weakening the recommendation. Assign confidence:

- **High**: decisive contracts and representative evidence inspected; no major unresolved assumption.
- **Medium**: direction supported; one or more material assumptions remain testable.
- **Low**: thesis mainly opens the frame; decisive evidence is absent or contradictory.

### 9. Design the verification path

Specify:

- First proof point: cheapest artifact or observation that distinguishes this thesis from alternatives.
- Expected signal: observable result supporting the thesis.
- Falsifier: evidence that forces rejection or material revision.
- Deferred commitment: irreversible choice not to make before the signal arrives.

Make the proof point test the target model, contract assumption, boundary, or payoff; showing that code can be written is not enough.

### 10. Close the payoff ledger

For each major bold take or kill-list item, record:

- Price paid now.
- Specific pain removed or capability unlocked.
- Moment or signal when payoff appears.
- Stakeholder receiving the payoff.

Reject rows based solely on "cleaner," "simpler," "more maintainable," or similar generic claims.

## Output Contract

Produce one strategic direction judgment in the user's language, using the template in this file. Keep its eleven sections in template order, Thesis first through Payoff Ledger last.

Output rules:

- Lead with the call; methodology and caveats follow.
- Keep target model separate from migration path.
- Give every compatibility mechanism a named contract, owner, and retirement condition.
- Use code-level detail only when it changes the direction or verifies a claim.
- Tie every ledger row to a bold take or kill-list item.
- End with the ledger; omit a second summary.

## Gotchas

- Diff size is a price, not a strategy.
- Give the three option rows distinct tradeoffs.
- Give every bold take a falsifier; testability matters more than provocation.

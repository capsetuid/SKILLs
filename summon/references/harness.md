# Harness reference

What a delegate starts with, per harness. "Not documented" means the
vendor documentation surveyed does not state it; treat it as a thing to
probe, not a thing to assume.

| Harness | Primitive | Delegate inherits | Skill access | Caps and limits | Return |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `Agent` tool; `isolation` for a fork | project instruction hierarchy, git status, working directory; no parent conversation. A fork inherits system prompt, tools, model, and history | skill tool present by default, so the delegate can discover and load; the definition's `skills:` field preloads bodies at definition time; blocked by omitting the skill tool or listing it as disallowed | 20 concurrent, and the 21st spawn fails rather than queuing; nesting depth 3 by default; 15,000 tokens across all agent descriptions | final text only, never intermediate tool calls; scanned and marked when instruction-shaped |
| GitHub Copilot | `runSubagent`; `/fleet` for parallel, `/delegate` to the cloud agent | workspace, permission and tool scope; no parent conversation | instruction files auto-attach by `applyTo` glob and stack without override; an agent's `skills:` array is injected in full at agent start; prompt and chat-mode files need explicit attachment | 30,000 characters per agent prompt; about 1,000 lines per instruction file, beyond which the vendor states quality degrades | not documented |
| Google Antigravity | `invoke_subagent` | terminal prefixes, file scopes, sandbox settings; clean slate on conversation history | rules load by glob, always-on, model decision, or manual; skills auto-load by description match | 12,000 characters per rules file; nesting depth 10 | not documented |
| OpenAI Codex | opt-in only: a plain request for parallel agents, or an `[agents]` entry in config.toml or `.codex/agents/*.toml` | model, reasoning effort, sandbox policy, permission mode, tool set, working directory | skills auto-discovered from `.agents/skills` with progressive disclosure, metadata first and body on selection; whether a delegate re-reads AGENTS.md or inherits the parent's discovered skills is not documented | AGENTS.md concatenated root-down, capped by `project_doc_max_bytes`, 32 KiB by default; about 8,000 characters of skill metadata | the parent waits for every requested result, then returns one consolidated response |
| DeepSeek Harness (dsh) | `dsh-tool-subagent`, plus `dsh-tool-subagent-control` for send_message, interrupt_agent, list_agents | nothing by default: each child gets a new flat tool scope, and the caller passes an optional `toolFilter`. A fork provider inherits a completed-turn prefix of the parent log; spawn and ACP providers inherit nothing | the Agent Skills SKILL.md contract with six-tier non-recursive discovery; whether a spawned child auto-loads skills is not documented | not documented | typed: `SubagentStartRequest` carries an optional `outputSchema` (JSON Schema) for the result; otherwise the child's last non-empty assistant message |
| OpenAI Agents SDK | `handoff` transfers control with the full history; `as_tool` calls a sub-agent with generated input and leaves the answer with the orchestrator | handoff: everything. as_tool: only the generated input | not documented | not documented | handoff: the delegate owns the conversation from then on. as_tool: a tool result the orchestrator keeps |

Handoff prompts in the OpenAI Agents SDK carry the SDK's recommended
prefix, which tells the delegate it is part of a multi-agent system.

## Probing an unknown harness

Dispatch one probe delegate before the first real brief.

<template for="probe">
OBJECTIVE
Report what you start with. Do no other work.

CONTRACT
Return exactly these five lines:
tools: <every tool name available to you>
skill-listing: <present with N entries | absent>
skill-load: <the first line returned by loading skill "<name>" | the exact error>
project-instructions: <the first line of any project instruction file in your context | absent>
cwd: <your working directory>

BUDGET
Three tool calls. On hitting it, return the lines you have settled.
</template>

Read the probe against the table: skill-load succeeding puts the delegate
at Invocable, a reachable file with no skill tool at Readable, neither at
Sealed. Absent project instructions mean every repository convention the
task depends on travels in the brief's evidence field.

# Reach

How a named skill gets into a delegate. Take the first variant that holds,
reading top down. The order is reliability of the text being read, not cost:
preloading spends tokens up front whether or not the skill is needed, and
buys certainty that the body is present.

| Variant | Holds when | What the brief does | Standing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Preloaded | the agent definition names the skill under `skills:`, so the body is injected at start | names the skill only | documented |
| Invocable | the delegate has a skill-loading tool | commands the skill by name in slash form; the delegate loads the body itself | measured |
| Readable | no skill tool, but the file is reachable on disk | gives the absolute path and says to read it before starting | measured |
| Definable | no preload exists, and the harness hot-reloads agent definitions | mints an agent definition naming the skill under `skills:`, then dispatches to that type | documented, untested: the agents directory must exist at session start, since the docs require a restart to pick one up |
| Sealed | none of the above holds | excerpts the binding rules into the brief's rules field | documented, not observed |

Sealed arises when the skill tool is omitted from the delegate's tools or
listed among disallowed tools, when the skill is marked as not
model-invocable, or on a harness with no skill loading at all.

Point rather than paste wherever the delegate can load the skill itself.
Excerpting is the Sealed branch alone, under the excerpting law in
`dispatch`.

Where a harness preloads skills at all, it does so at agent-definition time,
and the prompt is the only call-time channel.

Probe rather than assume. An unfamiliar harness, or an agent definition with
a restricted tool list, settles in one probe delegate (procedure in
`harness`), one delegation that settles reach for every later one.

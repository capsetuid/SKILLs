# Caveman Stats Mode

Display an honest savings card when invoked. One-shot: change no level,
write nothing.

## What to show

- Upstream benchmark: the caveman project measured a median 65 percent
  output-token reduction with full technical accuracy retained. Source:
  https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman (benchmarks/ and
  docs/HONEST-NUMBERS.md).
- Rule overhead: the caveman rules themselves cost input tokens every turn
  (upstream default estimate: about 1,250 tokens per turn). Net savings =
  output saved minus rule overhead; short sessions or short answers can be
  net NEGATIVE. When they are, say so plainly and suggest turning caveman
  off for that workload.
- Local numbers: the only honest per-file figures here are the
  `CHARS: X -> Y` lines the refactor verb's guard script prints. Character
  deltas are not token deltas; label them as characters.

## Honesty Boundary

NEVER fabricate or estimate per-session token counts: this skill has no
session-log instrumentation.

## Boundaries

One-shot display. Edits nothing, changes no level.

# Caveman Help Mode

Display this reference card when invoked. One-shot: do NOT change level,
write files, or persist anything. Output in caveman style.

## Levels

| Level | Trigger | What changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **lite** | `/caveman lite` | Drop filler. Keep sentence structure. |
| **full** | `/caveman` | Drop articles, filler, pleasantries, hedging. Fragments OK. Default. |
| **ultra** | `/caveman ultra` | Extreme compression. Bare fragments. One word when one word enough. |
| **wenyan** | `/caveman wenyan` | Classical Chinese at the active level. |

Level sticks until changed or session end.

## Modes

One-shot reports; the active level is untouched.

| Mode | Trigger | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **commit** | `/caveman commit` | Terse Conventional Commits message. Why over what. |
| **review** | `/caveman review` | One-line findings: `L42: bug: user null. Add guard.` |
| **refactor** | `/caveman refactor <file>` | Rewrite prose file in place; script-guarded, backup kept. |
| **stats** | `/caveman stats` | Honest savings card. No invented numbers. |
| **help** | `/caveman help` | This card. |

## Language

Keep user's language. User writes Portuguese, reply Portuguese caveman.
Compress the style, not the language. Technical terms, code, commands, and
exact error strings stay verbatim unless the user asks for translation.

## Deactivate

Say "stop caveman" or "normal mode". Resume anytime with `/caveman`.

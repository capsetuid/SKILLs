# Git Commit

Draft and review Conventional Commits messages, saying why over what, at
the cheapest effort level that works.

## Registry

| Name | Path |
| --- | --- |
| `full` | [references/full.md](references/full.md) |
| `ultra` | [references/ultra.md](references/ultra.md) |

Effort levels gate history scanned and text produced. Default: **full**.
Switch per invocation: `/git-commit lite|full|ultra`. Each level's name is
its registered name; **lite** loads none, **ultra** loads `full` before its
own.

| Level | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **lite** | Subject line only; scope from staged paths; no history scan. Cheapest. |
| **full** | Scoped subject plus wrapped body and footer; scope resolved from recent history. Default. |
| **ultra** | Full, plus an atomicity and history-consistency audit before drafting. |

Read ONLY the reference files the active level lists. The core rules below
apply at every level.

## Push Verb

`push` is a quick-ship action: stage as directed, commit, then push to the
tracked remote, reporting the pushed range in one line. Without an explicit
level, `push` implies **lite**; an explicit level wins, so `full push` and
`ultra push` draft at that level first. Run `git push`
ONLY when the user passed the push verb or asked to push.

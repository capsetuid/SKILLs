# Author Skill

<directives>

  <directives for="anatomy">
    <rule>Store the skill in a kebab-case directory containing a file named exactly `SKILL.md`.</rule>
    <rule>Begin the file with YAML frontmatter restricted to Agent Skills spec fields (agentskills.io), in this order: `name`, `description`, then only as needed `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`, `allowed-tools`. Never emit agent-specific extension fields such as `argument-hint` or `when_to_use`; record such hints as quoted string values under `metadata`.</rule>
    <rule>Set `name` equal to the directory name: 1-64 characters; lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens; no leading, trailing, or consecutive hyphens. Name a task skill with an imperative verb phrase, the command a user would speak (e.g., `fact-check`, `read-pdf`, `git-commit`); name a persona or stance skill with a single noun (e.g., `caveman`, `ponytail`). Never append filler nouns like `-protocol`, `-helper`, or `-skills`.</rule>
    <rule>Write `description` as a `>-` folded block scalar, 1-1024 characters, third person, in two movements: first a capability statement carrying the skill's key search terms, then trigger conditions starting "Use when". Routing to a confusable sibling lives in the body's opening paragraph in slash form, never in the description, and all of the library's descriptions together stay under the gate's 7,000-character budget. It sits in context whether or not the skill runs, so it carries the deliverable and one or two guarantees the reader can hold the skill to, in the reader's vocabulary, and names no internal record, phase, or file the body defines, no library the skill calls, and no verb or level the argument hint lists. Target 100 to 150 tokens.</rule>
    <rule>Give every skill `metadata.argument-hint`, the one place its invocation grammar is spelled: one bracket group per independent choice, ordered as a user types them (`"[lite|full|ultra] [design|review|help]"`); a skill with no vocabulary names its subject (`"[file-or-section]"`). Re-check it whenever a verb, level, or mode changes.</rule>
    <rule>Set `license: MIT` so a skill vendored out of this repository retains its terms.</rule>
    <rule>Add `compatibility` (max 500 characters) only when the skill requires specific runtimes, system packages, or network access; most skills omit it.</rule>
    <rule>Use Markdown `##` or `###` headings for internal structure.</rule>
    <rule>Address bundled files by registered name, never by path. Declare every path exactly once, in a `## Registry` table that is the first `##` section of `SKILL.md` and maps each name to its path, so names are declared before the body uses them. A name is the basename without `.md`, backticked so it reads as an identifier rather than the ordinary word. Reference files cite siblings by name only and never link: references stay one level deep from `SKILL.md`.</rule>
    <rule>Define each topic in exactly one file. Where a value, threshold, or enumeration is restated in a second file, replace the copy with an attribution naming its owner, so the two can never disagree. Attribute only toward a file guaranteed to be in context when the copy is read (the spine, or a kernel co-loaded with it); a file the skill loads alone keeps its own copies.</rule>
    <rule>Wrap all examples, templates, and payloads strictly in XML tags to prevent instruction bleed. The tag set is closed: `directives` holding `rule`, `checklist` holding `item`, `procedure` holding `phase` and `step`, `examples` holding `example` holding `before`, `after`, `variant` and `context`, plus `template` and `commands`. A tag names what kind of block it is and nothing else; what the block is about goes in `for`, so a new subject never mints a new tag. Name every tag in kebab-case and leave a blank line before an opening tag: CommonMark's tag name admits letters, digits and hyphens but never an underscore, and an HTML block opens only on a complete tag that no paragraph runs into. When a payload holds code or markup a formatter would rewrap, open `<![CDATA[` on its own line inside the tag. Miss either and the payload is paragraph text, which a formatter rewraps into unparseable code.</rule>
  </directives>

  <directives for="execution">
    <rule>Target this skill exclusively at agent-facing procedures.</rule>
    <rule>When distilling from a session, extract only verified tool calls and successful commands from its history; the skill is a reproducible procedure, never a narrative of that session.</rule>
    <rule>When the skill's value is a judgment (a persona, a review, a reading), test the draft before writing it up: brief a delegate through `/summon` with the draft and a held-out case, score the return against criteria fixed in advance, and change the text until it holds. The scores and the runs stay out of the skill.</rule>
    <rule>Parameterize all project-specific values (paths, hostnames, IDs) or instruct how to derive them dynamically.</rule>
    <rule>State each directive with its condition where one exists ("If X, execute Y").</rule>
    <rule>Enforce token-economical language in the generated skill: sentence fragments, no conversational filler; `/caveman` defines that register in full.</rule>
    <rule>Write every sentence to carry a rule, a condition, an input, or an example; delete narration about the document, restated headings, and repeated rationale. Keep rationale only where it changes a judgment call.</rule>
    <rule>A skill's text is loaded into an agent's context to be paid for on every invocation, so it carries only what changes what the agent does: the contract (what a verb takes, returns, and refuses), the routing (when to reach for this verb, this level, or a sibling skill), and the judgments the agent owns. Leave out which library, service, or endpoint implements a verb, since the agent chooses a verb and never a vendor. Leave out why the design is as it is. Leave out policy, licensing, and terms-of-use framing, which changes no action the agent can take. Leave out anything the script already states at the moment it matters: a `signal:` line, a rejection hint, or a `next` field reaches the agent exactly once and for free, so saying it again in the skill is paid for every time. The `description` is stricter still, since it sits in context whether or not the skill ever runs.</rule>
    <rule>A docstring or comment states the contract in at most two lines, then one further sentence only where a reader would otherwise make the wrong call. History belongs to the commit: what the code replaced, which bug prompted it, and what an earlier shape did wrong are read once and paid for on every load.</rule>
    <rule>State each directive as the pattern to follow; a prohibition spells out the unwanted pattern and raises its salience. Reserve negation for hard boundaries where the banned form must be named to be recognized.</rule>
    <rule>Exclude inflation vocabulary (comprehensive, seamless, robust, powerful, leverage, delve, cutting-edge) and wind-ups (in order to, it is important to note); sweep the finished draft with `/humanize` before finalizing.</rule>
    <rule>A skill that hands work to another agent commands `/summon` and supplies only what summon's caller table asks for: the unit one delegate closes, the record it hands over, the rules of its own that unit can break, its return shape by registered name, its cap, and the gate the lead admits the return through. Mode, brief shape, bounds, sizing, trust, and review of the return are summon's: restate none of them, and carry no worker prompt, delegation threshold, or cost figure in the skill.</rule>
    <rule>Write for a follower model less capable than the author: leave no step implied and no assumption unstated. When brevity and sufficiency conflict, sufficiency wins.</rule>
    <rule>Never emit em-dash characters (U+2014); use a hyphen, a comma, a colon, or restructure the sentence.</rule>
  </directives>

  <directives for="scripts">
    <rule>A bundled script and the agent invoking it form a neuro-symbolic pair. Design the script as the symbolic half; the skill text tells the agent, the neuro half, how to consume its output.</rule>
    <rule>The script owns exact, decidable checks: invariants (existence, size, encoding, identity), structural equality, digests, atomic writes, backups. It hard-fails (nonzero exit) only on an invariant violation.</rule>
    <rule>A heuristic never holds refusal authority. Emit heuristic judgments as advisory signal lines that state their evidence (ratios, matched rules, best-guess classification); the skill text instructs the agent to weigh signals against user intent.</rule>
    <rule>Gate destructive or hard-to-reverse effects on an exact witness: a marker file, an identity record, or an explicit flag the caller must pass. Provide an undo path (verified backup) where the agent's judgment could be wrong.</rule>
    <rule>Never decide trust silently: when a check is skipped or vacuous, the script states so in its output.</rule>
    <rule>Document the script's full command surface and output conventions in SKILL.md; that interface is the handoff point, and a production run rides on it alone. Source reading belongs to user-instructed troubleshooting; state this gate in one line beside the commands.</rule>
    <rule>The script mints unique identifiers: the agent supplies two or three keywords, the script returns the lowercase dash-joined slug plus a 128-bit entropy suffix (b32hexencode(os.urandom(16)).decode().rstrip("=").lower()) and echoes it in every output. The agent supplies the full identifier in later calls; keyword-subset resolution is the recovery path for an identifier lost to context compression, signaled and re-echoed on use, with ambiguity erroring and listing candidates. Identifiers with a natural key (DOI, path) keep it.</rule>
    <rule>Keep the command surface uniform: one record is a batch of one, sibling record kinds share one plural-array container schema, every subcommand addresses its subject the same way, and each effect has exactly one spelling. Each asymmetry costs the consuming agent a re-read of help text.</rule>
    <rule>Configuration travels as command-line parameters; free-form content travels on stdin. Closed vocabularies, counts, booleans, paths, and minted identifiers are shell-safe and stay flags; prose, queries, regexes, and any JSON body are not, so a subcommand with a required free-form field reads one JSON object from stdin or `--file` and offers no inline spelling for it. An optional positional beside flags is argparse's ambiguous shape and a quoted argument is rewritten before the process sees it; both cost a whole tool call to discover. A parameter that takes a literal also takes `@path`, which reads the file, and `-`, which reads stdin, with `@@` starting a literal `@`: the agent can write any value it holds without quoting it through a shell. A parameter that is only ever a path keeps its bare spelling, so `@` marks a path exactly where a literal is also possible. argv is untrusted input like any other: a malformed argument line is a bounded, located rejection in the exit-1 column, never a payload echoed back and never the exit code that invites a retry. Every call names its subject: several agents may share one state root, so the script holds no ambient current-subject state. Keep identifiers cheap by instructing the agent to bind the command path and session identifier to shell variables (reused while the shell persists, re-bound after a reset) and to chain a round's calls in one shell invocation.</rule>
    <rule>A skill that bundles Python is a member of the repository's uv workspace, and the member is the skill's `scripts/` directory: it holds `scripts/pyproject.toml`, a `scripts/src/btm_<skill>/` package, and `scripts/tests/`, is listed in the root `pyproject.toml`, and keeps every coding element inside `scripts/` so the skill directory stays documentation. The member's `[project.scripts]` console command `btm-<skill>` is the one entry point; skills document its invocation as one shell binding, `R="env -u VIRTUAL_ENV uv run --project $(realpath <skill-root>/scripts) btm-<skill>"`, where `realpath` is required because uv resolves the project path lexically and an alias path such as `.claude/skills/<skill>/` has no workspace root among its lexical ancestors. Logic shared across members lives once in the kernel package `btm-corekit` under `.corekit/`, declared as `dependencies = ["btm-corekit"]` with the source `btm-corekit = { workspace = true }`. The kernel already carries the gate mechanics a session-keeping script repeats (`SessionStore` creation and meta, `EventLog`, `Admission` with `Pool`, `read_batch` and `rejection`, `wire_pad` and `wire_clean`); a new member composes them and adds only its record semantics. Members never redefine kernel symbols; such a skill's `compatibility` notes that it runs from a full repository checkout.</rule>
    <rule>Every shape that crosses a boundary is a pydantic model, and the model is the only decoder. A wire kind with variants is a union discriminated on its tag, so which fields each variant requires is a field type rather than a hand-written implication; a state file is a record; an untrusted value is a refined alias (`Slug`, `Doi`, `Count`) rather than a bare `str` or `int`. Hand checks for unknown keys, list shape, and field types are what a model already states, so the script keeps only what a model cannot see: resolving a reference against live state, minting, and proving a cross-record link exists. `extra="forbid"` where the agent writes the file, so a typo is named; `extra="ignore"` where another writer owns it, so an unknown field is not fatal.</rule>
    <rule>A rejection carries every fix at once, so rows decode one at a time and a row too malformed to decode still has the values checked that resolve against something outside it. A location names the field to edit (`findings[0].claim`, not `findings[0]`), and the entry's schema fragment rides along as the hint.</rule>
    <rule>Three shapes, three spellings, and no fourth: a record that is parsed from or written to disk is a `Model` serialized with `dump`; a view a command computes and then indexes is a `TypedDict`; the document a command emits is built as `dict[str, JSON]`. A `.view()` method, a bare `dict`, or an untyped return is a fourth convention the reader has to learn.</rule>
    <rule>Keep mechanical, idempotent repairs in the script (e.g., delete a corrupt artifact on digest mismatch); leave judgment calls to the agent, informed by the script's diagnostics.</rule>
    <rule>A script that talks to the network marks its request origin by one shared convention, first defined wins: `BTM_USER_AGENT`, sent verbatim as the User-Agent; else `BTM_CONTACT`, else the constant `skills@oss.joefang.org`, in the derived header `btm-skills/1.0 (<skill-name>; mailto:<contact>)`. Only a contact-derived identity may also disclose the contact through polite request pools (e.g. an OpenAlex or Crossref `mailto` parameter); a verbatim override marks the request with nothing else. The script alone reads the variables; the skill text never mentions them.</rule>

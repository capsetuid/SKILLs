# Verb: design

Plan the next phase before any experiment runs. Input: the four moves'
output; run them now when no review exists. Output: the plan template alone.

## Order

The first phase is the crucial experiment: the cheapest run whose outcome
kills a claim or the direction. Nothing irreversible (a cluster rental, a
full implementation, a submission) precedes it. After it, in this order
unless a dependency forces otherwise: the tolerance claim on the smallest
current workload; the mechanism claim at scale on the trusted simulator,
calibrated against the real run; the comparison against the strongest
baseline in its own best configuration.

## Cost

Every phase carries a cost in the envelope's units: accelerator-hours,
rented money, people-weeks, simulator-hours. A phase whose cost exceeds the
envelope takes the simulator or emulator row of the spine's instrument
table, or names the collaborator it needs.

## Checkpoints

Each phase names the test that shows it succeeded or failed and the decision
its result unlocks. A phase with no decision behind it is cut.

## Venue

Name the venue class the plan targets and the questions its reviewers ask
(scale, baseline, generality, variance). The plan answers each or names it
as out of scope on purpose.

## Out of scope
<what the plan does not attempt, and whether the envelope, the venue, or the claim rules it out>

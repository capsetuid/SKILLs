# Verb: review

Judge one artifact, a paper, proposal, draft, or result set, after the
four moves. Read-only: no file changes, no re-run of experiments. The
output is the template alone; its Direction section is a headline, and
`design` expands it into a plan.

## Sound

Sound lines name what was checked; silence means unchecked.

## Direction

One paragraph. Where the project wins given the constitution, the currency
table, and the envelope; which claim goes first; what the lab stops doing.
The target is the pattern's "what it has to show" row. Route what sits
outside the lens per Redirects.

<template for="review">
## Constitution
<origin 1> + <origin 2> + ... [+ new]. Patterns: <rows from the spine's table>.
<one line per mechanism: the mechanism, its origin with citation, and its tag: as-is, tweaked (what changed), transferred (from where), or new>

## Setup
| element | paper | current practice | class | source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
<one row per element: scale, topology, substrate, hardware, workload, baseline, metric>

## Envelope (assumption)
<compute, network, data, people, money: one line each; "unknown" where unknown>

## Claims
1. <claim>. Instrument: <row from the spine's table, made concrete>. Kill test: <outcome that ends it>.
2. ...

## Direction
<one paragraph>

## Sound
<at most three lines>

## Ask
<the one question whose answer changes the direction, or the word none>

## Completion Checks

<checklist for="verb">
  <item>The template's sections appear in order with nothing around them.</item>
  <item>Every mechanism line names an origin and a tag, or is tagged new.</item>
  <item>The Setup table has one row per element, each classed and sourced.</item>
  <item>Every claim carries a concrete instrument and a kill test.</item>
  <item>The Direction names the first claim to test and what stops.</item>
  <item>Nothing was edited.</item>
</checklist>

description: >-
  Provisions a project's development toolchain in userspace: no sudo, no
  docker, nothing installed globally, and nothing assumed present but uv.
  Tags such as python@3.12, kotlin:android, go:cgo, rust, typescript, or
  haskell name the toolchains a project needs. Tools published for one CPU
  architecture still run on another, so an arm64 machine can build an
  Android project whose tools ship x86_64-only. Everything lands under one
  disposable root, leaving the user's own HOME, caches, and toolchain
  variables as they were. Use when an agent must build, test, or lint a
  project on a machine lacking its toolchains, or when root or docker is
  unavailable. Also use it when arm64 must run amd64-only build tools, or
  when several languages must coexist in one reproducible environment.
  Do not use for CI runner images, system package administration, or
  deploying services.

  uv on PATH, network access, and a full SKILLs repository checkout. Linux
  and macos on x86_64/arm64 are first class; windows x86_64 is best effort
  (haskell, bash, c, cpp unavailable there). Roughly 1-6 GB under the
  environment root, depending on targets.

# Setup Env

One command provisions everything a project needs into one disposable
root: run it, source the printed activation script, build. Re-running is
the repair action.

## Registry

| Name | Path |
| --- | --- |
| `cli` | [scripts/src/btm_setup_env/cli.py](scripts/src/btm_setup_env/cli.py) |
| `model` | [scripts/src/btm_setup_env/model.py](scripts/src/btm_setup_env/model.py) |
| `steps` | [scripts/src/btm_setup_env/steps.py](scripts/src/btm_setup_env/steps.py) |
| `catalog` | [scripts/src/btm_setup_env/catalog.py](scripts/src/btm_setup_env/catalog.py) |
| `plan` | [scripts/src/btm_setup_env/plan.py](scripts/src/btm_setup_env/plan.py) |
| `render` | [scripts/src/btm_setup_env/render.py](scripts/src/btm_setup_env/render.py) |
| `effects` | [scripts/src/btm_setup_env/effects.py](scripts/src/btm_setup_env/effects.py) |
| `targets` | [references/targets.md](references/targets.md) |
| `extending` | [references/extending.md](references/extending.md) |

The console command `btm-setup-env` is the entry point. Read `targets`
before choosing tags beyond the obvious; read `extending` only to add or
change a recipe. Invoke the command and read its output; read source only
for user-instructed troubleshooting.

## Procedure

Name as tags only the languages the project uses. The grammar is
`family[:flavor][@version]`: family picks a toolchain, flavor picks what it
builds for, version pins it. `list` prints every known tag.

<commands for="setup">

```bash
env -u VIRTUAL_ENV uv run --project "$(realpath <skill-dir>/scripts)" btm-setup-env provision <tags> --project <project-root>
```

</commands>

`--project` defaults to the nearest ancestor of the working directory
containing `.git`. The environment root is derived from the project path
(override the base with `DENV_HOME`, or the exact root with `DENV_ROOT` or
`--root`). Pass `--json` for machine-readable output.

<commands for="examples">

```bash
# A python + go + typescript monorepo, python pinned
btm-setup-env provision python@3.12 go typescript

# Android work on any host, including arm64; API level as the version
btm-setup-env provision kotlin:android@35

# Generic kotlin (JVM), or kotlin compiled to native binaries
btm-setup-env provision kotlin
btm-setup-env provision kotlin:native

# Systems work: cgo needs a C toolchain, so it is a flavor
btm-setup-env provision go:cgo rust cmake

# Preview the plan without executing anything
btm-setup-env plan haskell csharp
```

</commands>

Expected: `Environment ready under <root>`, one `ok` probe line per
toolchain, exit 0. Then activate and work; every command is identical on
every supported host:

```bash
. <root>/activate.sh        # POSIX shells; activate.ps1 on windows
```

Verify later with `status`, wrap a stray foreign-architecture binary with
`shim <binary>`, delete the root with `destroy`.

## The Interface Is The Whole Contract

- Exact toolset: the environment contains the union of what the named tags
  require and nothing else.
- Conflicts are errors before effects: two versions of one toolchain, an
  unknown tag, or a target impossible on this host all fail during planning
  with a precise message, never mid-download.
- Idempotent: an interrupted or failed run is repaired by re-running the
  same command. `provision` with a different tag set reshapes the
  environment to exactly that set.
- Versions left unpinned resolve to the newest available build; the
  chosen versions are recorded in `<root>/manifest.json`.

## Isolation Invariant

Every mutable path lives under the root: HOME, TMPDIR, XDG dirs, and each
toolchain's cache and config variables are redirected by the activation
script. The project checkout is written only when a build tool demands a
generated, ignored file (`local.properties` for Android). Nothing reads the
caller's HOME, dotfiles, or global toolchains; nothing writes outside the
root and the project.

Falsifier: run a build through `env -i` carrying only the activation
script. A pass proves independence from caller state.

<checklist for="isolation">

```bash
env -i /bin/sh -c '. <root>/activate.sh && cd <project> && <build-command>'
```

</checklist>

## The Architecture Fact

Some publishers ship a build tool for exactly one platform. How a host
reaches a foreign binary is a total function of (host, needed platform),
decided in one place (`model`) and answered by first-class variants:

| Host | Foreign linux-x86_64 binary runs via |
| --- | --- |
| linux/x86_64 | direct execution |
| linux/arm64 | qemu user-mode emulation against a conda-forge sysroot |
| macos/arm64 | Rosetta 2 for osx-64 binaries, transparently |
| windows | unsupported: emulation is a linux mechanism |

Nothing downstream branches on architecture: the emulated tool is one
executable at one path, registered where its consumer looks (aapt2 through
`android.aapt2FromMavenOverride` in the isolated `gradle.properties`), and
its wrapper writes nothing to stdout.

## Gotchas

- uv is the only assumption. A bare ubuntu:24.04 image with uv works: the
  scripts never call curl, git, tar, or unzip binaries.
- Activation redirects HOME, so git identity and ssh keys are absent inside
  an activated shell. Build and test there; commit from a normal shell.
- The prefix create step replaces the whole prefix, so the planner merges
  all host packages into one call; never hand-install into
  `<root>/conda/host` with a second call.
- Toolchains pinned by the project (gradlew, package.json, Cargo.toml)
  stay authoritative: the android recipes install no gradle and no kotlin.
- Emulated tools run slower: minutes for a full Android resource pipeline
  where native takes seconds. Correctness is unaffected.
- The root is ephemeral (under the system temp dir unless `DENV_HOME` says
  otherwise). After a reboot, re-run provision.
- Narrowing the tag set reshapes the conda prefix exactly but leaves stale
  publisher downloads under `<root>/tools`; run `destroy` and re-provision
  for a byte-exact minimal root.
- Recipes were validated end to end on linux (both architectures); macos
  and windows follow the same code paths with best-effort edges.
- macos/arm64 Android builds need Rosetta 2 once:
  `softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license`.

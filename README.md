# SKILLs

A library of reusable [agent skills](https://agentskills.io): each skill is a
`SKILL.md` procedure an LLM coding agent loads and follows. Every skill is
project-agnostic (no hardcoded paths, names, or services) and self-contained
(one directory: `SKILL.md` plus optional reference files and scripts).

Install them with `npx skills`, as a Claude Code plugin, or as a git
submodule.

## Available skills

| Skill | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [advisor](advisor/SKILL.md) | Reads a research project as a principal investigator would: what prior ideas it combines, which parts of its setup the field has moved past, what the lab can afford, and the cheapest experiment that would prove or kill each claim. |
| [aesthete](aesthete/SKILL.md) | Designs and reviews web interfaces to a WCAG 2.2 accessibility floor, applies a supplied brand or design system, and strips the templated look of generated UI. |
| [author-skill](author-skill/SKILL.md) | Writes and reviews skills; every skill here was authored under it. |
| [caveman](caveman/SKILL.md) | Compresses agent output into terse phrasing to cut token cost, and rewrites a prose file in place reversibly. |
| [fact-check](fact-check/SKILL.md) | Checks a document claim by claim against retrieved sources, quotes the evidence behind every verdict, and applies corrections only after per-item approval. |
| [git-commit](git-commit/SKILL.md) | Drafts and reviews Conventional Commits messages, and can commit and push in one step. |
| [humanize](humanize/SKILL.md) | Rewrites AI-sounding text in its writer's voice while keeping every claim, working from a documented catalogue of AI writing tells. |
| [lit-review](lit-review/SKILL.md) | Runs a literature review where the criteria are fixed before the first search, every exclusion carries a reason, and every citation traces to a paper it retrieved. |
| [peer-review](peer-review/SKILL.md) | Reviews a paper as an adverse referee: verbatim claims, objections admitted only when quoted and sourced, and a recommendation that follows from whatever survives. |
| [pl-theorist](pl-theorist/SKILL.md) | Code design, review, and refactoring grounded in typed domain modeling and stated complexity, with advice tuned to each language's runtime. |
| [ponder](ponder/SKILL.md) | Answers an open question with a source behind every load-bearing claim, the strongest rival explanation tested, and whatever stays unsettled reported open. |
| [ponytail](ponytail/SKILL.md) | Pushes every change toward the simplest working solution: fewer dependencies, smaller diffs, standard library first. |
| [read-pdf](read-pdf/SKILL.md) | Extracts text and metadata from a PDF file or URL and answers questions about it with page-cited evidence, writing nothing. |
| [reframe](reframe/SKILL.md) | Produces a testable direction judgment, with costed routes, when planning has locked onto incremental or legacy-bound framing. |
| [search-web](search-web/SKILL.md) | Searches the web, Wikipedia, and the scholarly record for an agent whose harness has no search tool, and returns the readable text of a page. |
| [setup-env](setup-env/SKILL.md) | Provisions per-project toolchains entirely in userspace, without root or docker, assuming only uv on PATH; tools built for another CPU architecture still run. |
| [summon](summon/SKILL.md) | Hands work to another agent: whether to delegate at all, what the delegate must be told, how to keep parallel agents off each other's ground, and how to judge what comes back. |
| [thematic-analysis](thematic-analysis/SKILL.md) | Develops themes from qualitative text under one named school, backing each theme with verbatim extracts and counts, with defaults tuned for feedback and ticket data. |

## Installing

### With a skills manager

Install every skill, or pick individual ones, into whichever agents you use:

```bash
npx skills add BTreeMap/SKILLs --all
npx skills add BTreeMap/SKILLs --skill fact-check --skill git-commit
```

### As a Claude Code plugin

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add BTreeMap/SKILLs
claude plugin install btm-skills@btm-skills
```

### As a git submodule

Pins an exact commit and updates on your schedule; the bundled sync workflow
below automates the update. Add the library at `.github/skills` and alias it
for Claude:

```bash
(
  set -eu
  if git submodule status -- .github/skills >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "Already recorded: repairing the checkout to the recorded pointer."
    git submodule update --init -- .github/skills
  else
    echo "Adding the skills submodule."
    git submodule add https://github.com/BTreeMap/SKILLs.git .github/skills
  fi
  mkdir -p .claude
  ln -sfn ../.github/skills .claude/skills
  git add -- .gitmodules .claude/skills .github/skills
  if git diff --cached --quiet -- .gitmodules .claude/skills .github/skills; then
    echo "Already up to date."
  else
    git commit -m "chore: Add agent skills submodule" \
      -- .gitmodules .claude/skills .github/skills
  fi
)
```

The block is safe to re-run; advancing the recorded pointer is a separate
step (see Staying current).

Clone consuming projects with submodules included:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules <your-repo-url>
# or, on an existing checkout:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Staying current

### Manually

This route needs neither a third-party action nor extra permissions:

```bash
git submodule update --remote -- .github/skills
git commit -m "chore(skills): Bump skills submodule" -- .github/skills
```

### Automatically

The bundled workflow fast-forwards the `.github/skills` pointer to the
upstream tip twice a day, one commit per configured branch (default: `main`,
`master`, `dev`):

```bash
(
  set -eu
  mkdir -p .github/workflows
  if [ ! -e .github/workflows/sync-skills.yml ]; then
    echo "Installing the sync workflow."
    cp .github/skills/sync-skills.example.yml .github/workflows/sync-skills.yml
  elif ! cmp -s .github/skills/sync-skills.example.yml \
      .github/workflows/sync-skills.yml; then
    echo "sync-skills.yml differs from the bundled example; leaving it as is." >&2
  fi
  git add -- .github/workflows/sync-skills.yml
  if git diff --cached --quiet -- .github/workflows/sync-skills.yml; then
    echo "Already up to date."
  else
    git commit -m "chore: Enable agent skills auto-sync workflow" \
      -- .github/workflows/sync-skills.yml
  fi
)
```

Copy the workflow in as a real file: GitHub Actions silently ignores
symlinked files under `.github/workflows`.

The workflow is third-party code running with `contents: write`. Its
containment:

* The jobs skip cloning and checkout entirely, so no submodule code and no
  git hook runs.
* The token is split across two jobs: a read-only job decides what to bump, a
  `contents: write` job only creates the commit and moves the ref.
* Commits go through the Git Data API with no author, committer, or signature
  field, the documented condition under which GitHub signs a bot commit with
  its own key. The bumps therefore satisfy a `Require signed commits` ruleset
  with no stored key or bypass actor.
* The upstream is whatever URL the branch records for the gitlink, so a fork
  with the same layout works unchanged; `upstream-url` and `upstream-ref`
  inputs override it.

If your organization restricts third-party actions, allowlist
`BTreeMap/SKILLs/.github/workflows/sync-skills.yml@main`.

## Repository layout

```text
<skill-name>/SKILL.md          canonical; one directory per skill
skills/<skill-name>            vendor-neutral hub; one symlink per skill
.github/skills -> ../skills    GitHub Copilot, and the submodule mount
.claude/skills -> ../skills    Claude Code
.claude-plugin/                plugin and marketplace manifests
```

Every vendor path is one symlink to `skills/`, so another agent costs one
link. Edit skills at the root and keep every alias a symlink. The CI gate
writes and prunes the aliases and regenerates the skill list in
`marketplace.json`, the address installers resolve each skill by.

Git preserves symlinks on Linux and macOS; on Windows, enable Developer Mode or
configure Git to create symlinks before cloning.

## Contributing

Conventions, the CI gate, and the frontmatter protocol live in
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md); the authoring procedure is
[author-skill](author-skill/SKILL.md). CI repairs mechanical findings
(formatting, ordering, aliases) on every push and fails only on what needs a
person.
